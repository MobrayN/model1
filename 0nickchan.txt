is a math expression
in palera1n discord
i posted an expression that gives nick chan's age
thanks
and gir appears to be utc-4
because im in utc+8
yall are actually late
ill leave as soon as i stop being hoisted
presumably
uicache is corrupted
ipados 16.0 20a8372
on a version with no ipsw
i boot looped with it
macdirtycow
on ios 12 sshrd
i think sftp-server and ldid is broken
as in that some bins in the ramdisk is not compiled for ios 12
why is the bootstrap on apt.procurs.us just broken
im hydrated
it cannot be used to untether ios 15
and although that bug exists on ios 15
this is why a certain bug can be used to untether all of ios 14
the problem is the greatly reduced attack surface
that isn't the problem
though untethered rootless is practically impossible
so im not dev
and i don't have the dev role
well it's a bit more complicated than that
effectively anyways
forced to
as i thought
flower has no genius
honestly
anyways this *should* be the correct destination
what is the destination
click on the i button
you need to fix the link
check liblz4.1.dylib
see if any of them are symbolic links
i mean, identical issue aside from the randomized path obviously
the dylib may be a broken link
im thinking like
usually
i come here to look at tags
this is completely unrelated
sorry i just want to look at it
send zefram source code
palera1n loader leak
would fit me very well too
it looks pretty
i need to get that orange coloured role
*old mempro
member pro already degraded so much
are member edition whitenames now
palera1n
on rootless
reset all contents and settings will remove all files
it does
how would they know
so people are happy
wdym it can be implemented as executing mobile obliterator
succession ios 15 is called settings general restore all contents and settings
hydration coming up!
and im scratching the surface
i invested more than that in jb
not happening
ratioed by palera1n 16.4
you are not getting jailbreak.
deviceinfo ecid
of course those would be non issues if it's backup editing instead of editing files live on device
can only do it over ssh with shell history disabled
and you cannot delete it using filza
palera1n 2.0 beta 5 dropped
lasted for 227 days
why is my channel list so short
use pc to activate
because uh
ok maybe it will work
you can use that as is for the most part
will need to patch the ipad 5 dtre using values from the ios 15 iphone 6s dtre
boots to restored external with ton of messages because of dtre mismatch, restored_external starts and eventually hardware wdt timeout (not panic)
then it would boot to com.apple.xpc.launchd
you need the ipad 5 dtre
iphone 6s on 16.0 beta 6 better
(note it is extremely potent and drinking more than a few ml of that is dangerous)
not if you drink glacial ethanol
please stay cool and hydrated
omg hydrate mod
pretty sure i posted the description every time i make a pre released
how get developer
gatekeeper is going to explode
ok ig that's good
just use releases
you are on master
(it only happens with at least one tweak installed)
would not recommend
ellekit generates bootloops right now on rootless palera1n beta
legacy exists
say bye to your battery health
just not published anywhere
have rootless cydia, even
it just sucked
we already have it
four days at the same time earth rotation humanoid square pyramid
rootless
appearently
wait legacy is in current jailbreaks now
in fact not found a way without disabling sip or exploiting in some way
for some reason
however when you write to it it starts taking up space
because it obviously needs to store the snapshot name somewhere
well technically it takes up like less than 1 kb of space
like fr
plus choicy disables tweak injection but not the injection of the tweak injection platform itself (substitute)
which needs substitute injected in order to work
choicy itself is a tweak
so if you don't userspace reboot it should be fine
however, normal palera1n runs substitute when wifid is already started
or have issues in general
most notably if substitute is injected into wifid then wifi won't work properly
actually, wifi has some issues in palera1n
palera1n only support ios 15 and above
replay the apticket
how come did you have developer role
i think
need developer
and not fork+exec
plus some of those actually requires a refractor
there are at least 2700 calls to (v)fork in procursus
need (v)fork for xina
has been a long time since i last used it
nick chan not being a whitename is out of orindary
because arm64
not iphone 5
they would say iphone 5s
if they at least know how to fake better
that literally is impossible
6s on 12.4.2 is ultra rare
but it is on 12.4
i wish that 6s was on 12.4.2 though
12.4 does not have chimeramoment
because you get chimeramoment
how long ago is
this phone was never upgraded because it was broken
probably not on new ios though
this is also a 16 gb devices
iphone 6s plus
this is actually an a9 on ios 12
also, view code does not work
this is on ios 12.4
on ios 12
is the github website just borked
k bye
and for actually using the jailbreak well that's on ios cfw guide
the answer is literally $(use google) as far as how to get linux goes
then get linux
just jelbrek it with palera1n
because "without jailbreak"
then load a modified one that uses the arch -x86_64 command to execute it
all you need to do is unload the system plist
it crashes
one time i tried to run windowserver in rosetta
real sourcelocation
i am not using life waste
very quick
i got 6s on 12.4
maybe discord is being dumb and kept that ip banned
try using a vpn then
sounds extremely overkill
oh the 16 gb version too
i bought one so i can write notes
you need to somehow write to the hypervisor heap
i also need it
but i can say the same too
translated: wen eta m2 ios 16 jelbrek
and be absolutely bad at being a mod
im mod in a certain server
the desktop app is literally a site specific browser anyways
why not just use the discord website
com.apple.private.hypervisor
you will need to manually allow discord to access every iokit user client class that it wants to use through even more entitlements
like vpn entitlements
how about special non private entitlements
need to define message logging again
where unless screenshoting are message logging
cream pie indeed
nick chan is not a cerified discord user
john xina
i need the actual certification
where certification
no one
what server frfr
nalpha
why is john xina verified
there is a separate sileo beta which is not sileo nightly
sileo nightly is a test version of sileo
ios 16 rootless
and then the server is successfully delted
then someone rewrited the instructions for xina
well the initial instructions comes from aaron
it becomes a jailbroken sim locked device
(very fr)
aaron
...it's not
i forgot
wait why am i even here
in fact they are instructed to delete it because people are spamming (sometimes piracy) invite links in the server with no one to stop them
... i have additional context, it's not deleted due to misunderstanding
just use var containers bundle on 13
sandbox.kext
the debs are most definitely signed
i saw that x2
no i did not forget
but it wouldn't get past that
i think so
and also weightedbufs has no chance working on a10(x) and lower
because of additional mitigations
how would i know? because i tried it
because it is way too slow
then jailbroken
then suddenly userspace reboot
device boots to lockscreen first
plus untethered taurine would look really ugly
permasigned taurine
i gave up charging that ipad
i think restoring 14.5+ on below will bootloop
taurine-permanent
14.3 is golden fr
and newterm is not in procursus
cuz it's intended to be a procursus clone
you still need to get newterm from old nickchan
system cmds is on palecursus
palecursus also has non rootless 1800 and 1900
new one
u missed one
99 gigabytes
99g    procursus-p1
after compiling all of these stuff
i need to see how big my procursus-p1 folder is
yeah ik i have the rest (mostly)
i still have way more packages
u inserted a space
u typed it wrong
no you are better off just mounting on it with krw
cuz you still control every userspace process 100%
for an end user literally anything possible before that does not include persistence should be possible
rootless is unrestricted
cuz the db is deleted
no one is registered
sileo nightly repo is filtered because they filter gay
remember sileo nightly repo is filtered in xina discord
i went into this server to search for "saily"
xina uses rooted strap on rootless
sudo apt remove package-name-as-in-package-field
i think best to delete this tag
plus it is still in testing phase
cuz using rooted on rootless is ehhhhhhh
i still would not recommend using it
mineek has one
which would also affect sileo
therefore many bootstrap components does not work correctly
keep in mind that xinaa15 uses rooted strap on rootless
aka not "leak" but no official link either
but did not actually give any link
xina said anyone can test
semi offical
can't say anything yet until it is released for real
but uh libtakeover is lgpl-2.1
it's not necessarily bad
xinaa15 fr fr
including the redacted ones
well all known source code copies of u0 either says mit license or bsd 3
although it certainly has u0 code
no it's not
and yes these are unc0ver strings
real strings from xinaa15
not normal situation
this is about invalid llb
with invalid llb signature
does it not go into dfu automatically
it would say 45s when it is like 5s
chargehook timing is horribly broken
thanks
shortcut that sends a message with a webhook
and at that point it would be my problem
cydia seems to use libapt so it probably can't explode while parsing repos without apt also exploding lol
don't mind me but cydia doesn't explode with my configurations
and the symptom is that it would not be able to find any package
it breaks horribly in any sort of repo configuration that's not the most standard one
to this day i can't understand why i keep hitting sileo bugs
idk pink flower seem better
omg omg why no genius flower
wait omg pink flower
i can just use xina's dm
i don't have telegram
it's in non developer closed testing phase
there is nothing interesting there
xina does not look at my profile
are they both inaccurate?
in simulator
i need to install working sileo
i have procursus installed in a simulator
xcode simulator
it still involves copying around 15 mb of files
kinda rootless but not really
(there is a tweak injected into the battery icon)
i guess mobilesafety.dylib counts as a tweak
at long last
it breaks dyld interposing
why does substitute wants to hook into random command line bins
substitutelog: subhookfunction: substitute_hook_functions returned substitute_err_func_too_short (0x100e05c2c)
1800 on 1800 is fine
guaranteed bootloop
do not use the procursus 1700 dist on ios 15 (1800) it will bootloop the device
you tell me
sentinel no work for my device, it still continue to die at random percentage, including 100% and today it managed to die while plugged in
at gir
ill just write github issue
it is not a spoiler fr
it's in a code block
happens 100% of the time
guaranteed recovery loop
it is guaranteed to happen on rootless ktrr
actually
never
aka recovery loop
(kernelcache.bak still exists)
in preboot
the kernelcache will be gone!
if palera1n.sh is interrupt at just the right time
i know what is a 14.8.1 blob
i may restore to 14.8.1 later
arm64e
also the only known way to get arm64e ios 14.8.1 blobs
good for arm64e ios 14
you can dump disk1 using trollstore filza
remember hurricane is only 1% faster than cyclone
apple tv hd on tvos 16
that exists
why fr
ipados
watch as a11 gets ios 17
im on a11
that needs an iboot payload
also it is blackbird
apparently this is too difficult
go to google.com "how to install pip on arch"
how would you pip install pip without pip
how can an arch use not know how to install pip
u just need to install pip
how can an arch user not know how to debug that
well i have stable on one machine and unstable on another
ez fix
just get testing or unstable
need almost no maintenance and i have unattended upgrades turned on
i use debian im lazy right
nvm the ios version
wasn't there a service to enable jit with a vpn
the packages file of dynastic does not seem to exist
which repo is dev.ayden.ios.lib.sys.aurora on
nightly link
nvm up again
and futurerestore update check also no work
so palera1n no work
nightly link is dead
so fr and p1 also dead
nightly.link dead
ok i leave
now actually fix 15.1 and x86_64 freebsd
it's aight now
dfu is 05ac:1227
you can tell by listing usb devices on the host
i really want to post this again
palera1n cydia
palera1n cydia
palera1n cydia
like reading every file on the device
it also allow apps to have most otherwise impossible permissions
i can confirm that home button issues does not exist on iphone x
capitative home button no work (except iphone x)
palera1n uses active file because boot manifest hash is different in ssh ramdisk
i think
boot manifest hash
some ioreg stuff
nothing important
especially since linus failed to figured that out before fugu15 released
i just sent extra info that they may not necessarily know
read again
not necessarily
literally means washed, mean deleted here
i finally realised you are htrowii
deepl best
i can write the traditional characters and it works just fine
can != will
most likely yes
not necessarily so like
substitute reimplemented mobile substrate  api without it being open source
custom impl
arm64e jb tool
xinaa15 probably, checkra1n maybe
it seems to be a completely custom impl
i think xina actually made tweak injection from scratch
not necessarily out of beta
well maybe not
maybe
here me out xinaa15 will release before cheyote releases
there is no way
you can use the captive portal browser
the ramdisk
something is different in ios 16.1 already
galaxy moment
i have working sudo on palera1n
imagine having a broken sileo icon
i have an a9x ipad with battery that dies in 90 minutes
well that and ipad 5, yes
for ipados 16.0 your build id should start with 20a
do note that on a10 and a11 you need to have never set passcode since restore, and
possible
apfs ramdisk
i need someone to verify palera1n rootless not work on 16.0
and there are some caveats
not very easy
and i guess maybe some random w^x enforcement stuff too
amfi is slightly more strict now but for the most part it is fine
yeah except for iphone x for very obvious reasons
more tweaks
just emailed havoc about the crane migration which somehow is not transferred for me (i redeemed crane on packix with a code)
copylog work on ios 15
use a port on the motherboard
or remove it
the battery needs to actually die to fix
dfu won't fix it
wen ping everyone in rjb announcement
trollnonce scam a11
futurerestore
please help i cant use --use-pwndfu because futurerestore can't get keys
which is entangled with just the uid + gid + passcode but is then wrapped around with million rounds on aes so it takes time to recover
aka using the backup keyring
ok attempting data recovery
im downgrading to 15.5 beta 4 right now
which ik how that would work
the other way would be to use qemu t8030
probably
do it with a ssh ramdisk
no one wants those
need 130 entitlement to access all of fs
broken icon
there are many other missing stuff on there
for palera1n rootless
no i mean
and maybe sshrd_script too
obviously
add it into palera1n.sh
and start from recovery mode
--use-pwndfu
it literally works if i remove
the ticket does have a generator
from 15.6 beta 5
ok time to downgrade to 15.5 beta 4
and the patch point that jump into shellcode
so what did you do to the shellcode
ok now make bingner gib rootless substitute
how did you stash the shellcode
ok but wen eta full jb
please tell me should i downgrade to 15.5b4 from 15.6b5 a11
latest procursus ldid can do it
so in addition to allowing fakesign you also need to patch more to allow malformed fakesign
because ios 15 changed fakesign requirement
no, gib
should be able to get away with just the trustcache patch
i think a certain amfi patch needs shellcode
(or fix it)
you need to delete all shell code
because that case is interanlly treated as ups
so that's the use of ioupsd on iphone
it is managed by ioupsd
not by the normal charging stuff!
the iphone smart battery pack is handled by...
i think it first appeared in t8015
ane, not exist on t8010
og installer is hell
better than saily and installer 4
if you have ppl bypass it should still be possible to implement jb fully
wait maybe not really because ktrr but eh
pretty sure you can just forge whatever pointers auth if you have ppl access
cydia is deleted on procursus
not from apple
although i would just buy an adapter for elsewhere
should be fine unless you are using high powered accessories
what device  will you connecting the adapter to
since the beta alert started to appear on 15.6b5 yersterday
and yes i have blob
should i downgrade to 15.5b4 from 15.6b5
it sped up a bit then goes back down to 0
i have no cheyote compatible devices therefore i don't want cheyote
will consider
the current speed is exactly 0.000000000
there isn't anything interesting
i find info, about bullfrog, on some chinese government website
the exploit needs to stress the device
cuz thermal throttling
note: ipados 16.0 20a8372 is not a beta build
ipados 16.0 20a8372, is exactly 1 build number higher than ios 16.0.1, which is 20a371
k bye
delete reddit.app
imagine spamming reactions
appearently
that's an actual board id
what is a rpi3ap
until it happens again of course
and yes it does go away if the device is restarted
i just said bug
i know lol
this is bugged fr
it has to be
ipados 16.0 (20a8372) is just bugged
ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma
apparently this would render as a single emoji
k bye
person shipping a whole corecrypto blob in altserver
this gotta be piracy
just no trollstore
15.6 rc
technically there is
doesn't really matter unless you are trying to persist
probably good for bootleg rootfs
i have a 256 gb device
does nfr mining corp still exists
no exec prefix command moment
i guess so
all right
so you have a swift launchd?
what even is the command
for idownload
idownload trollterm
u posix spawn idownload then execve the actual launchd
eta wen
idownload in palera1n?!
need more functions in idownload tbh
idownload bad
and ur done
then stuff jbinit onto that
u getting free kernel patches at that point
if you get to pongoos then there maybe 10% more work to do
no fr
bootl crash
aka dreaded found corrupted kerninfo
especially on an a8
checkra1n can be faster than taurine
i think it was the payload overwriting llb
it can be
that runs on another ios device
there is also ra1npoc which is a checkra1n clone
last time i checked checkra1n does run on androids
just have a portable device that can run checkra1n
you can run code in el1
checkra1n
taurine 1.1.6
185 days
a bit more than half a year and it is dead in my definition
i define jb dead if no release in 2 years
i try to see when it is dead
when was checkra1n 0.12.4 released
sentinel is useless because my ipad could die at 100% battery
the newest build will have the correct dependencies
which would use apt file method
then install it using sileo
you must grab the deb
because apt https is broken
they used a broken procursus build
not a taurine issue
which is a video title
read it again
you are using auto partitioning right
hacked
harpy reloaded
last time i checked google classroom is an offender
when it is not
tweak that makes apps think passcode is enabled
this message was edited so the replies makes no sense
a jailbreak tweak is a dynamic library containing instructions to modify one or more process(es)
m2 ipad pro
how fix hv_denied
it is a 15.7 kernel
what ios version btw
and the 15.7 iphone x kernel patch is also public
which should at least semi-work for 15.4-15.7.1
i think they are just having you boot the patched 15.7 kernel
can you get uname -a
i somehow think that some of it comes from dora2ios
are you mismatching the ios 15.7 kernel
ios 4.2.5
how jelbrek iphone 4 cdma
kmutil for ios
eu iphones outside of eu as well as international iphones in eu will get ads
double the price
and iphones in eu is more expensive
like every a13 and above have it?
not sure
i think yes
rose firmware
also it works on a12 15.0-15.1.1 already
never
well on arm64 anyways
14.8.1 blobs are not useless
!t 15to14
you have to put stuff into the hash to not have it wiped in preboot
stuff installed with fugu15 will be randomly wiped
kernel ace need ppl and ktrr bypass
definitely not 4.97%
i know for a fact that this device has at least 10% battery health
doesn't sound very accurate
a real one
where can i see battery health
this is an a9x ipad pro
bruh this cannot be real right
x32 is the worst
so the conclusion is that
or as some linux people likes to call it, arm64 ilp32
how about arm64_32
how about aarch32
run checkra1n on ev3
wrong troll
and for x86 you would want to compile for i386 soft float
only patchlevel
since there is a distro where device almost never get sublevel kernel updates after it is released
for linux kernel 3.2.0
linux binaries better be completely statically linked against musl
k bye
where is the tvos 16 block ota profile
ok then i still gotta continue to suffer the binutils hell
you missed every ipad pro
brb need to generate the remaining ipad pro ipsws
just install libiosexec1
bypass it
i need to verify this
how can i verify this
in a fake iouserclient
tfp0 emulator with libkernrw
how hard is it to have a tfp0 emulator
it all come from redacted sources
launchctl.1600 and launchctl.1700 comes from 17a508
apple internal too
you can in fact pirate nano
i love charging with a nonexistent usb brick
it has to do with the dtre
what does you being 14 have to do with anything
fake uuid
im dumber than galaxy
i say that all the time
wait no
you can get that from ssh ramdisk
ssh ramdisk
without it being disappear
then you can make symlink
context: preboot getting wiped
man replied
i can wait 1000 days for a way to get com.apple.private.hypervisor entitlement on ios 16
so quite literally same chip same revision
they have the same cpid and cprv
and may even make some of those exploitable
but not write after free bugs
in particular- it kills read after free bugs
in fact it can also allow undefined behaviour to manifest in a new way
ios 16.0 factory firmware
not beta, not rc, not final
my ipad pro is on ios 16.0
well i guess ipados
device that never have ios 15
15.6 rc, not signed for my device
s5l8747 is haywire
a5-a11, t1-t2, s5l8747, s1-s3 are vulnerable to checkm8
how fix hv_denied, m2 ipad pro
should i buy $99 account
if they actually remove hv it would be hv_unsupported or even outright exc_syscall
plus i popped the kernelcache into ghidra decompiled it and is able to find the hv_initialize function
that means hv still exists
hv_denied, ipad pro m2
that's my tweet lol
let's say there is a fugu16, utm.hv is still dead for bad
which is wi-fi
the ipad is connected to personal hotspot
how fix
does otool not work for that
memory should be enough
and 4022 mb memory in pojavlauncher
i can make do with 3072 mb memory in utm
just like the network extension entitlement
unless these two are those restricted entitlements again
how can i use com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit, com.apple.developer.kernel.extended-virtual-addressing
at same period of time
alt implies using two accounts
you need to set nonce anyways
you can fix that with jb
on arm64e
can you mitm and replay and ota blob somehow
because they should sign it
bug pierre to sign it
isn't tswaps still like functional
ota blobs are real blobs
huh non functional
without actually upgrading
with mitm
how save
this device is currently on ios 16.0 build 20a8372
this is the output of --list-ios
that's also the only way to grab it on arm64e
mitm attack
how fix
im talking about 16.2 beta
ipad14,3 ios 16.2 beta
i can't find the ipsw on appledb either
how to do
what do next
tsschecker -e 000 --apnonce 000 -g 000 --beta --buildid '20c5032e' -s -d 'ipad14,3'
i need my boobs
where are my 16.2 beta blobs
i want know how to draw on screen
where src code
you do know both of these devices though?
someone should submit a driverkit request to apple for 05ac:4141
05ac:1338 is soft dfu
which is not all that important for jb
why are there no mail plugins
sshrd script
it literally won't work even if you resign every binary
too funny
i want to paste in this link again
"fr because it is the only message they could fr"
public mod logs
why so many fr
there has been ios 15 exploits for a while
eta now
no thanks
i can jb google chrome with fake jbs
md can probably also do it
wholesome
frozen nonce
why is my xp progressing so slowly
does apple sell usb a to usb c cables
who is nick chan
just boot custom software then
it would need more power to boot. - i think this ipad can output at least 20w?
idle = lid closed, caffeinated, not doing stuff
not even 10w at idle
cuz m1 pro is like
the real issue is whether the bootloader will let it boot like that
ehh, it should have enough power with most the peripherals turned off
my ipad is charging my macbook pro right now
you should grab the #0001 tag onto this account
apparently it filters relative paths too
orangera1n
blob saving shortcut
time to setup the shortcut
and irecovery -q
will ideviceinfo reset it
what actions will unfreeze the apnonce
this is the oldest version this ipad can go to
first thing i think of is pojavlauncher
im going to stress my new ipad
i need to sideload at least one app first
found it
and where is developer mode
it does work even if the device never have ios 15
!t blockota
yes they have ios bugs
asahi lina's bug
patience was set to 1000 days successfully
although m2 jb is going to be incredibly difficult
it look like the sort of person that would release bugs
gpu driver bug
there is a funny bug fixed in 16.1
can i at least get boobs
launch day m2 ipad comes on that build
where can i find ipados 16.0 20a8372 ipsw
on tss saver
i found it
and also tss saver
i guess so
work on cpid 8112?
can i use blob saver
legit no idea
how do i save boobs on arm64e
now i need to figure out how to save boobs
brickstate is false now
just that it is not set up
that doesn't mean that it is locked or anything
got new device
k bye
the file size is listed
where
pzb get
there is a 15.7 iphone x kernel patch floating around
what if you use the 15.7 kernel on iphone x
they really decided to pop ios
arm64 14.8.1 blobs are not useless
yeah vim
go to sileo
this is not a good place to stay
k im getting out of here
what if nick chan thinks it is also over
galaxy is great
where to find macos 10.15 aa and libapplearchive.dylib
then half of the developers would have genius
level 5
where filter
14.8.1 ipsw
yeah does sound like some sort of pac bypass
pac bypass (?)
how come tweetshift does not have bot role
that was actually referring to galaxy
ofc restore with a 14.8.1 ipsw
14.8.1 restore ipsw
i should too i think
go to sleep.
15.6 beta
so they have to release 12b12 to fix that
that happened with 12b11
and procursus ldid
remember to get the trustcache tool
need test
makeipsw.sh is done (i think)
fixing the update ramdisk allow restore without erase
we use the 14.8 update and restore ramdisks
14.8.1 ipsw
it works
it really is random fr crashes
fr explodes with a demoted device
because a lot of faceid issues
not out
isn't 15.7.1 like
bruh wtf
the device does boot without -u
futurerestore has update drm
and the solution is try again
currently im trying yet again without -u just to be super sure
that sound like an ios 12 max device moment
and yes that's a custom 14.8.1 ipsw
and this is the command
it doesn't happen without -u
does pwndfu updates work with fr?
dyld variables
it's useful
you need the trustcache tool now
a deb file is a posix tar file
filza extract debs by spawning dpkg-deb
progressing nicely with buildidentities enumeration
how get array length, plutil
i make custom trustcache and booted with that
i didn't patch the kernel
im so lazy
need to enumerate buildidentities and not to be lazy fr
there is literally nothing not even an actual ui in that app fr
i guess my 14.8.1 ipsw maker script works now
dfu *must* be manual without a custom cable
libusbk
you can pwn checkm8 on windows itself though
found a 3.7 mb ipsw
favourite root dmg
no more galaxy
i can see the difference
gaiaxy
i eventually will not right now xd
or rather not yet
i never do patches
darwin bootstrapper control interface
it's confusing enough
user id
nitro booster
mocking rn
idk i don't have galaxy's files
i can consider
amfiret is amfi obviously
balls
such as redcated and redacted
all i know is that a lot of such webclip tools breaks localization
and atv 4k ipsw script
how make 14.8.1 ipsw script
that one specifically because it is signed
main issue you need the macos 10.15 `aa` and `libapplearchive.dylib` for tvos 13.4.8
it's all figured out in the span of 2 days
make scripts?
so what are we going to do with the 14.8.1 stuff
no you aren't
when mass produce 14.8.1 ipsw
exploits are made
you find vulnerabilities not exploits
yeah true
found rick
hi rick
where rick
it's galaxy 0007 now
well the tag changed obviously
honestly something like this is fine but it is nick chan
i literally don't have a test device so i can't
and no one will know that i figured out half of the stuff
then you can pwned restore
after running the asr imagescan command then basically take the 14.8 ipsw
no copyrighted code
the template is 4mb big
trustcache
because pwn restore
it doesn't have to match
i figured out a lot of stuff
only work on arm64
can confirm
faster
or i can just drop an arm64 version into there and it would run fine
and restored external
that is if i know how to patch an arm64e asr
fix stuff until it wants to work in qemu
in any case i can pwned restore qemu t8030
restored_update
it also performs some other operations on the rootfs
you have to consider the restore process too
then put the new files on there
resize it as necessary
i think the easiest way is to literally take an existing dmg delete all files,
working 14.8.1 pwned restore
im fighting hdiutil
i still fighting hdiutil
incompatible changes
i have no idea how to get the libapplearchive.dylib and aa binary from macos 10.15
i think
you need macos 10.15 to extract tvos 13.4.8
and does not reflect the new techniques
note that's quite outdated
downgrading `aa` now
well whoever that wants to restore to tvos 13.4.8 on apple tv 4k i guess
and libapplearchive.dylib
so i need to downgrade aa
backwards incompatible
it's all messed up
issue is
to macos 10.15 one
tvos 13.4.8
i think you need to downgrade `aa` to extract
13.4.8 ota
can't extract
*what*
there is no fixup.manifest either
so that part can be skipped
app_patches
tvos 13.4.8 ota has no
so apple tv 4k has a recoveryos
this restore method will not work for ios 15+
downloading tvos 13.4.8
to drop down some notes
ill download tvos ota
with same method as 14.8.1
well ig it is possible to restore to 13.4.8
skull
wait linux-apple depends on checkra1n
skull
atp you are better off using linux-apple
i think it *might* be possible to restore it
bruh emoji
cuz no ssv moment
this method should work for tvos 15 and 16 too
hm maybe i should try dumping the tvos 13.4.8 rootfs
gzip bomb
why is log upload disabled
moment
not in sshrd.sh
afaik the ramdisk for atv hd and atv 4k is exactly the same
need to modify sshrd.sh
does tips work
but anyways the device still boots
it sounds plausible that we actually missed some stuff
are you staying on 14.8.1 fr
are you staying
it no work on ios 14 arm64
13.4.8 specifically because it is signed
cuz staged_system_apps moment
im fr
does tips work
you need hint from nick chan
already done
it is essentially restoring to "14.8.0.5" first then replace the rootfs
no ipsw
rootfs ota dump
restore 14.8.1 worked
wait green again
i have manticore ipa
how is manticore not filtered
nuts pain
already figured out how dump root fs from ota
without a ipsw
i mean
i think it's not impossible to restore to tvos 13.4.8 on apple tv 4k
in the dmg
there is an efi
the decompressed size is actually a bit bigger
well ig is fine
that's what im worried about the most
the dmg is a whole 200 mb smaller than the 14.8 dmg
ik ota extraction for some times
especially 13.4.8 since you can still get new blobs
this is also true for every apple tv 4k
signed
apple tv 4k
also remember
galaxy did it
because ssv
they are on ios 15
not arm64e
what i described will only work on arm64
with the 14.8.1 created rootfs
then use a ssh ramdisk to replace the rootfs
it's to restore 14.8 rootfs with 14.8.1 boot components
plus the easiest way to restore is to not use a created dmg
which we can also patch out with checkm8
in the filesystem image
the parts that are mismatched are like free space and random paddings and file orders
the binaries is certainly valid
bro this ain't ios 15 ssv
why would iboot freak out
you don't need it in normal boot
only the restore needs checkm8
checkm8 restore
checkm8
and stuff
metadata
free space
the parts that are different are random padding
you need pwned restore but i think so
it is just the checksums won't match
it's not particular hard to make one
moment
14.8.1 rootfs dmg

there are no obvious ports on the apple pencil
how do i expose the port
how jelbrek apple pencil
this chat has been getting worse lately
im getting outta here
why does this gif trigger eta
unc0ver
unc0ver
plus i think in some ios version release notes apple said `filesystem contents outside of the sandbox can no longer be used for validation` but obviously it is ignored
can they put it in info.plist though
and then the detections will be removed
this will trigger some detections
apple should just make everything in protected paths eperm
access system call
fork()
why is my rank increasing
not the whole bundle id
im talking about substrings
there is an app on app store with that, not reliable
and stuff
i mean if they are actually a dick they can check for substrings in bundle ids
revoking free accounts = "this apple id cannot be used for development with xcode"
imagine if they start revoking free accounts
udid registrations is not sketchy
ps2 compat hack
how many hardware and software bug is needed to allow for cfw from userland on ios device
i lost flowerbreak gui
and allow views to be more extreme
ignore caps
it is evaluated differently
flowerbreak
(although it can rejb just fine)
ra1npoc does not include bootstrap upload btw
see: manticore
id say 99.9%
no they are not
all i know is it already broken on some previous versions so it is good to assume it is broken on 8 as well
no idea
the reason i said every version separately  between 14.4 to 14.5.1 inclusive is because these versions uses hardcoded offsets
it would be supported for as long as it does not use hardcoded offsets
and 14.6-14.8 is for a12-a13 **iphone**s
14.4,14.4.1,14.4.2,14.5,14.5.1 is for arm64e only
and versions above 14.3 are restricted in one way or another
anyways unc0ver supports 11.0b1-12.5.5,13.0b1-14.3,14.4,14.4.1,14.4.2,14.5,14.5.1,14.6-14.8
but said it support anyways
lying requires the person to know that it does not support it
doubt
only checkra1n
checkra1n
one at 4 am and another one at 5:01 am
i have this automation running very early in the morning
resell the phone
then you have onboard blobs right now
they have blob for 15.6 rc
and buy another phone on ios 14
sell it again
shrug
you get like 0 support on 12.1.2 so
i left this server like 1337 times
and fdr issues
and baseband
how block rapid security response
the apple polishing cloth is not compatible with the new m2 ipad pro
chimerafix
sounds like palera1n
every "member" there is at least half decent
this better
mozilla 5.0
that's the best way to statically compile stuff
have a fake cross compile even if it is native
that's all i could say
you need to "cross compile"
galaxy should xd
"how bypass dpkg locked"
but hi alpha
accessing stuff on a locked device isn't bypassing it
the context is jailbreaking from webkit
not on arm64e
note no lock is bypassed here
may need slight modifications though
could work
that's the hint
captive portal
it's possible to reach google.com without bypassing the lock so it is not completely useless
radio
odysseyn1x
stop lying fr
ping pong
oh no im getting out of here
ios application archive
am i in a fubar state
plus i think tweak support somehow needs krw
so not entirely boot args
there is an amfi patch in palera1n though
the development kernel allows illegal vm operations when boot arts are passed
wel ig you can but atp it is better to just use irecovery
i mean a custom bare metal payload
not because of account disable stuff though
my discord account is practically linked to my real identity already
there
wireless ibus
and always automatically check the ipsw can be reconstructed
ota and ipsws are compressed; which makes storage them together quite inefficient

my only jb device
well that ewaste ipad is still used for jb testing
to replace that ewaste ipad
when it comes out
i think i might by m2 ipad
it exists on b3 and does not exist on b5
does the installd bug exists on 15.6b4
or something like that
it will probably be 1 million
yes that exists
www.com
there is at least one video of arm64e trollstore 15.6b3
it exists on b3 at least
and fastpath bug exist on b5
but not on b5
it exist on b3
with 1536 mb dict size
tar.xz
problem solved
just filter both http and https url for that again
so it is like a full substring
trollstore.tar extracted, you get the actual .app, and there happens to have a fake site for trollstore that also ends with .app
filter urls with protocol instead
please remove filter of trollstore application bundle
arch users are, arch linux users are not
and i used `of` here because im forced to
then you obtain the application bundle of trollstore
trollstore.tar extracted
all i know is the folder name of the application bundle of trollstore is also filtered
that's what the dm is for
gm mai
because it is
there's a reason i said the battery is literal ewaste
well i mean whole device replacement at apple store
it is replaced at apple store
this is not a ripoff battery
how come this battery is at 50% capacity after only 461 cycles
50% battery health 461 cycles
this battery is literal ewaste
where do i get com.nathan.fr
im getting out of here
pogo is useful for one thing on arm64e
palera1n loader app
all i know is if i click install then i get sileo
just trollstore
everything is verified in the checkra1n loader app
this is garbage
i need to find an actually usable ios terminal app fr
superuser hiii
the installd bug is gone on that version
trollstore works
ios 15.6 b5
gta car tracker no work
15.6 beta 5
somehow the beta alert hasn't arrived yet
thanks
where do i get "com.niceios.battery" ipa i forgot
i think some 15.6 betas can't use trollhelperota
trollstore does
trollhelperota does not work on 15.6 beta 5
how come i did not see the beta alert yet
there
k time to set brickstate to false
brickstate
see im dumb galaxy is the fr expert
why is the. device in 0x1227
so i just need to go through like 2 hours of setup
not itunes backup though
ehh i have a copy of everything on this device
it is sending filesystem xd
i forget to specify -u
well fuck
so it couldn't have been gatekeeper
gatekeeper won't care as long as you download and extract using cli
killed 9 and it isn't gatekeeper
ok restoring xd
and yes im running fr in rosetta
19h12 is both 15.7 and 15.7rc
how come this not work
--custom-latest-buildid 19h12
redacted
wait ecid
now how about this
that's the main issue
it gives cryptic error messages
it isn't but futurerestore wants it
sep literally is not involved here
and yes linux_fix.sh has been ran
macbook pro charging 1%
technically anyways
better app compatibility
15.5 beta 4
i go to 15.6 beta 5
please think about 16 gb devices
then crash right away in dyld
i actually get the binary to run in full security
ios 12.6
imagine what happens when you have container required and no container
even if that is a thing there are entitlements that will make everything explode when used together
need to spam entitlements
remember the entitlement list
am i a normal user
just apples pov of jailed
not really jailbroken
trollhelperota no work macos
this is what you think it is
tar xf trollstore.tar will reveal redacted
k im out of here
fake website that ends with app and the ios application bundle also have an extension of app
fake website
so i can fix trollstore with it
i hope gta car tracker still works after futurerestore
of which is almost dead on ios 15 anyways
but as always the sandbox is leaking air which makes file detection possible
sandbox hardening after dyld has ran
amfi launch constraints
omg mineek dev
because apple decided that it should
where can i find trollinstallerv2 (not trollhelperota)
and by trollstore application bundle i mean the folder that is inside trollstore.tar
because the trollstore application bundle would have the same name as the domain of a fake site
wait i think i know why
and a path to it
like the extracted app bundle
although it is totally normal for actual capacity to be higher than design capacity
but for some reason apple does not show above 100%
so it stays at 100% at some time
most likely it is above 100%
5 years.  79% here
how old is a launch day iphone x
k i will restore 15.6 beta 5 later today
well i mean use the gta car tracker app again
need to reinstall
trollstore will be nuked with an upgrade though
in terms of exploits
there is literally no difference
on arm64
im on 15.5b4
restore to 15.6b5
should i just
whoever tested it, are they sure it is not launch constraints messing around
please tell me that the ct bug is patched in 16.0 beta 1
im out of here
i need compatibility for using gta car tracker and trollhelperota at the same time
related to bridgeos
the wikipedia ipa is under mit
how big is gta car tracker originally
not if it is wikipedia ipa
then i will have more
now send me more injected ipas
now i have two troll helpers
15.7 still signed
binja
hopper
trust me
i touched a disassembler
i guess so
develop for templeos
driverkit is a gold mine anyways
i do think that is patched in 15.5b4 though
i can look at it in ghidra i guess
how buy fugu15 t shirt
donate $500 000
actually that might be too little still
then maybe
donate $5e5
not really, no
apparently yes
see the 15.5b1-b3 advice
blob collection starts at 15.5b4 plus one 14.4 onboard blob
and id rather not break face id
at least when viewed from ssh ramdisk
gone!
i bootloop on 14.4
even for a complete noob
ehhhh 10 years should be more than enough
you can untether tvos and audioos 15 with coretrust bug
on 15.5b4
does persona.kb corruption exists
and it turns out that linus made a mistake
because aaron said they confirmed with linus
such a wait is workable with trollstore
maximum patience is set to: 1000 days
where pac and ppl does not exist
you can still do static analysis without the prerequisite
not from linus
you did not
you said you would leave
hm now the question is whether it works down to 15.4b1
using the recently released patch
tweak on 15.7 when
i doubt changing 12.5.6 to 12.5.5 will make anything less stable
well you can
unc0ver does
then do it
no device
does chimera use systemversion.plist
checkra1n better
the fastest timezone is utc+14
wasn't it like utc+11
you utc+13
unc0ver has weird drm
and if it does not match it explodes
typhoon con slides says eta 2023
no worries
wait it's night already
hydrationman
is nowhere to be found
odysseyn1x 2.16
all i know is arm64e is quite broken
85 ebadexec bad executable (or shared library). the executable or shared library being referenced was malformed.
does stuff work in bash
does it use posix spawn
so somehow it can spawn binaries
does ls work
no non-builtin command should work
how does uname -a work
but then uhh
it is most likely linked to libiosexec already
oh then you also need to patch fish to not use fork
is this fucking 15.5 beta 4
arm64e
and pls don't tell me this is arm64e
your fish better be linked to libiosexec
the only arm64 mac on which you can nuke all security is virtualmac2,1
no you did not
how about the custom boot object
permissive security literally is not no security
that doesn't allow you to boot custom iboots
you can't disable bootrom signature enforcement
and i can still use almost any entitlements
because funny
no i would like to be on full security
there is a 3 app limit for free accounts
that and can still download ios app from app store
how sideload unlimited ios app macos 12.3.1
boot args filtering
so it is not pointless
cuz apple restrictions
trollstore on macos when
arm64 slice on trollinstallv2
can someone send me a uh
im on 12.3.1 full security
no, reduced security definitely works
and i am on macos 12.3.1
in permissive security
you can't run ios app
as. you can see above
because the binary is malformed
lipo explodes
for trollterm to work arm64e no patched amfi
to not use fork
and a lot of stuff
you need to fixup bash
well yes the app itself works
the kernel exploit in fugu15 is a logic bug
those could also get unsigned
still valid argument
still did not get to do it
ill patch appstore++ later
writing to freed pointer exploit still works
preboot volume
they certainly can still happen
preboot is dead
and we can still do whatever we want with the processes
files does not control your device, running processes does
rootless is not trash
you are genius now
omg emma
~~ssh ramdisk~~
are there any other executable slices
then what happens on arm64 device
lol, so fugu15 still uses a bug from fugu14
with that bash script on
im going to wear headphones just as a bonus
linus henze's server is practically getting ddosed right now lol
uh oh
only work on linux
so far no sounds yet
is the alternative on non-linux
dqw9w4qgxcq
but it still goes to
changed
the tinyurl link
so checking the site for that sounds more reliable
that link is 100% going to disappear once it releases
both can work
pretty much
remember to set speakers at max volume
if i hear earrape it is released
and the speakers are turned to max
how to get battery health on ipad system info doesn't seem to be reliable
like right after that
then decides to output 3.65 v at another moment
somehow my ipad battery decides to output 3.9v at a moment
dm me2
do everything
apple t2 controller
ibridges comes in many variants
what about it
they have 1337 bootloaders
that's nothing compared to the ibridges
odysseyn1x v2.16
ibridge
homepod
how about apple tv
k bye
they are on twitter
someone
since pierre could remove them
it is not entirely unreasonable
that's what qemu t8030 did
it is hard
consider kaslr
remember
bsd 3
you need to know what is a "mask" and what is a "match"
by stealing checkra1n kpf patches
need to write patchfidner
remove dev kernels
and that's an issue
pierre will remove them
cuz pierre
this is literally iphone os 1 difficulty
wait no
in terms of difficulty
it's ios 8 all over again
dm wat
what is the palera1n boot args
k bye
the string is in macos
u don't
build 10m569 devicename usb-c to magsafe 3 cable (2 m)
never forget
updates-http.cdn-apple.com
somehow
unless you need unsafe kernel text
you can patch amfi
please patch release
vs xnu 8019
it does not work any higher
let me guess
does it work on patch release
cuz tfp0 check still exist
then how krw
on "normal" dev kernels
is enabled either
you neede krw
just as i guessed
palera1n
tell me
"how run tweaks"
yes thats a galaxy moment
kern.osbuildconfig
to be ran on the sep
gl with the average complexity of fifty quintillion
and even with blackbird which is not available on a11
you still can't
anyways im done
you have conflicting items
then don't jb
you do realize if you set a say like 20 digit passcode then force reboot people can't do a thing about it
need effective uid = 0
forgot
and if a space character is used as the delimited the snapshot name is the third item
cuz snappy -s prints like this
system snapshot: com.apple.os.update-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
cut strings based on a delimiter
and the nvram comamnd won't work as mobile
after step 2
reboot command is gone
keys are gone
that is encryption lol
although actually wiping the unrecoverable trash will take longer
it takes like 1-10 seconds for the data being unrecoverable due to keys wipe though
just go to settings and
read again
no time
the sep data keys would be regened
just do the standard wipe then
about applejb
give more info
not enough information (-3)
omg man joined
would not recommend wiping without restore rootfs though
nvram oblit-inprogress=5 && reboot
this is going to implode
why is hydrate genius
assertion failed: hydrate
and the reason it has to be executable is quite obvious
found another directory executables can be executed from
the original ones are a bit ugly
will redo patches
i know the specifics of doing that
i try have a9x odysseyn1x in upstream
error 3194
easier said than done
i would if i have the slightest idea
that doesn't work correctly either
i use debian bullseye
check dmesg
which would be the case for sshrd_script because that is a git clone
how compile plistbuddy static
on ios 15
need to figure out how to load a pongo.bin
compared to installed sep
or nathan_rd atp
sshrd more like util_rd
it would panic trying to set a passcode than actually set the passcode after reboot
just set passcode with fmi
so i can use 2 windows 10 pc
apple db has them
wait actually it is possible
how are you going to do it in time on t8015
u mean ios15 branch
unless you have custom one
kernel64patcher broke
ios 16 won't work
there's no krw
(note this is macos iboot)
i patched boot rom with kairos
which repo
and only do rsa patches
it just ignores my args
on pac bootloader
does not want to patch boot arg
why does kairos
need serial boot arg
boot arg that nuke security
you can if you factorise a certain 4096 bit number
i need to boot kernel first
virtual iboot funny
i can debug iboot now ig
no worries i demoted the vm
apple virtual machine 1
on cpid 0xfe00
i figuring out how to boot patched iboot
congrats for no life
how do i get ticket
im still whitename edition
whitename edition
how do i get a tss ticket for apple virtual machine 1
by bypassing most of them ofc
amfi_allow_any_signature=1
amfi_allow_research=1 is an actual boot arg
i have a9x device on 14
private key
apple secure boot root ca - g2
and yes i found it using disk destroyer
but then this requires code exec in ramdisk already so very useless
so you can write to arbitrary phys mem with it
practically anyways
u need to be able to write exploits first
15.0-15.2 beta 1
dssc race works with a9
pac ppl ktrr does not exist on the dcp
somehow
i know the isp coprocessor are two a12 little cores
then dma your way to the kernel
you jailbreak the dcp
i think
the iomfb bug is exploitable on a14
i make taurine run first
natalie 4699
you gotta overwrite *gender
green nathan
nathan 2 still exists
uh oh
flower reads all my dms
i have two files with the same sha1 hash
stalem8
with somthing else
just overwrite the owner pointer
revive serena
mohamed exists
dabezt is the alt
nickchan.kext has that
boot-args: nick_chan_get_out_of_my_way=1
woof pfp
although tbh it is very confusing even for galaxy and nick chan
we bamboozled arsenal too many times
that's actual galaxy
hey im level 60!
when kevin is member edition
it's not going to work
so unless it has like 0 dependency or only depends on `all` stuff
cuz there are no iphoneos-arm depends installed
most likely would not install properly
not sure
that's a time difference
from announcement to release
it took about 3558326952 ms for fugu14
gl finding that
i already sent it out to somebody else
if you have a_note_from_nick_chan.txt you would know the main reason
they are in sileo also
compared to the less than ideal background conditions
it's aight
just no compatible devices
it's not skill issue
i cant make use of that
shouldn't it be was
how boot ipados 16 iphone 7
if you can use checkra1n just use sshrd_script reset function lol
ssh ramdisk mobile obliterator
if var jb reboot
check for paths in iboot
if i leave and rejoin ill be mempro for 0.1 seconds
i have mem pro
then you are a whitename
is member edition whitename now
it does take slightly longer to boot obviously
deleting the entire rootfs on ios 15 will not bootloop if snapshot still exists
ok i tested
anyways bye

only restoresep needs to be compat
member hyper
member++
member plus
well unless you think the phone apart
dd dev zero dev disk0 bs 4096
those people think they are equal
it does not
not banned anymore
_sukuratchi
anyways move on
anyways that drama is stale, and coolstar 's not a scammer
i can see people call them a scammer because of the electra cydia drama
wait how many years ago is that
they answer questions more than actually chat here
less often than in sileo
that name needs to be removed from pwn20wnd.zip fr
to have safe mode
you need tweak injection
rip bozo
they did, just not recent at all
need to figure out how to restore using the protocol fr
apple inc debug usb
dfu dead on a16
that's the tswaps method
how would you get the bcert
it is just a bootstrapper
you mean signed via normal tss
and idk if making the device think itself is an ifpga would have other issues
ig you can patch that out
apfs kext panic
aka ifpga
like kpf dyld patch
doesn't some patches requires shellcode in memory
the real question is by how much
it still raises the bar
is funny
network link conditioner
and the current checkra1n payload overwrites llb on ios 15
that needs to be ran onto the device
hi dora
you have custom patcher?
pls fix kernel64patcher
with dead amfi
any idea pogo would work on ios 16
sideload springboard.app
no boobs
im on 15 5 b4
the boardconfig is whatever the device tree says it is
invalid board config
debug auth
launch daemons don't work
semi-untethered
i will send you arguments
need to include toybox deb though
just add an option to run debug shell lol
say hi
confirm password
and restrict it to
don't use login
if you want a debug shell spawn bash directly
normal repo?
for it to work
and shell
you need to set the password
remember
writing your own
so ssh is broke
untethered
do not work
launchd apis
uploading debs.tar
when my mac cools down
im making new debs.tar
eh it is more like u0+fugu14
essentially
sileo works with trollstore
uicache successful, have fun!
time to resign
does not use
uikittools
it is because
put simply
it's actually another issue
but it actually work
i make debs.tar again
so that means
at least chmod runs now
don't think so
new error
failed to install sileo 256
why is prep_bootstrap.she a thing
the commit message
borked
everything
literally
and also why
let me try again
is unsigned
so every library
to ldid
i forgot
ik why
the trollterm binpack is a backup
use trollterm
trollterm
somehow
signed
need to search for amfi
check console.app
at least
pretty sure they should work with patched amfi
literal
over 1000 debs
every deb
to send
it isn't possible
i hope i did not send you any broken deb
my strap is deleted
where dev branch
this is what happens when you click remove
so i can debug it
push it onto a branch
just push the test pogo onto a branch
public pogo needs it
then use ldid to resign every binary
to install it again
now i gotta boot with a patched amfi
i mis clicked
wtf is omg its gone
sileo
resign
you also need to
upload wptc track deb
is libiosexec signed
search for "libiosexec" in console.app
which binary are you spawning now
file not exist
enoent
protip
won't work either way
setuid bit doesn't matter
you can
just use chmod()
because it doesn't happen for me
ehh idk
just call chmod function
not using chmod binary
you should try
i can check
does chmod have
what entitlements
entitlements
console.app
i fixed 2048
2048 doesn't work
i need to get even more packages build
we have around 84.5% of procursus
wptc-track i think
it certainly is smaller than 100 compressed
compress it
add the 130 entitlements
right
to resign everything in the sign function
i use modified procursus makefile
the bootstrap i send you is signed
if you make sure every bin is signed it should work
if i have amfi patch
how would i use a passcode
sileo work without amfi patch
100% proof
already
i sent you my latest debs
are you going to do something with the debs
member hyper
printf debugging
i mean rootless bootstrap repo
is signed with ct bypass already
everything on the rootless repo
no amfi patch
amy has an app called pogo
i have a resigned bootstrap too
rootless debs resigned with ct bypass certs
what should i do with debs.tar
no idea
just gotta resign everything
no amfi patch
omg sileo work with trollstore
broken deep sleep
iphone os 3
ios 3 site
cuz if you lock the device for a while it will reboot itself
i have pogo
geosnow does not do that though
15.7 exists
pogo+kernel 64 patch defeats amfi
especially ios 16 is still signed
existing checkm8 a11 jailbreak users
it's somewhat practical for
*erase restore
ill start modifying jbinit
you need to mod it
you need to modify it
no rootfs mount patch
because
and try to auto launch some dameons
go fork jbinit
i guess i will have to
that's pogo
or just use codesign
install ldid
on a ssh ramdisk
it should be a broken symlink
after building
run codesign
just fix the actions
works
in trollterm
the exact same command
hm didn't work
anamyjb
why is it pogo
no idea
i guess
call it 'load daemons'
kernel ro
i faked a cross compile in my builds
skill issue
and devicetree
the next step is always to try patch the kernel
ipados 16
send serial output
on your ipt 7
does the kernel boot
cydia tss
i did told you
boot args is a sysctl
like how to read boot args
i get no credit for telling people how to do stuff
pongoterm is in your repo
delete it
nice serial number
what hardware
so aka even longer
a lot more stuff can be compiled  in my env
how long did it take
im still compiling procursus stuff
afaik no giant patches are required
the ramdisks
they are visible to me
sounds like i have a better setup
i can compile more stuff in procursus
ez fix
compress it
on kernel 8792
i think at least amfi patch works
does pogo work on kernel 8792
i have some idea how to
like jbinit
you need to figure out how to ramdisk haxx
are you going to replace tips again
code_signing_allowed=no
protip
forgot name
youtuber
what about whatever tech
blizzard will look like garbage if he did
he won't
ramdisk boot
so still apply even if you don't actually have mac
if you can't  figure out how to workaround it with github actions it isn't for you either
or some way of accessing kernel memory
you need tfp0 patch
that's it
and flex around
you can use sileo and terminal
that's the issue
there's no tweak
im building 1337 packages
those that take hours to compile
it is easy to make release.gpg
patch task for pid 0 or host get special port 4
i need to try to uh
right
it kernel panic
what if i try to install a tweak
iphone x global
gm chat this is totally real
stalem8
1 jan 2023 00:00:00 utc - 31 dec 2023 23:59:59 utc
ok bye
including the last second of it
that eta means somewhere in 2023
ok my brain is malfunctioning at 2:18 am hope i figure out 15.5b4 tomorrow bye
you mean remount
what is in tools
send pogo ss pls
what does pogo look like
hope i figure out 15.5b4 later
because the ramdisk is not persistent
and reboot into normal ios if auto boot is true
it would panic
like that
it will just panic when the restore starts
booting to restore mode still works with broken seal and renamed snapshot
linus means restore mode
by recovery mode
what if you make panic a no op
how do i make kernel not crash
which device
jelbrek 1tr
macos 1tr jailbreak
at least not impossible though
easier but still rather hard
need to compromise each one
to own the device
we need to control every coprocessor
the main issue is
bypass: just boot linux lmao
see coolstar did release an eta
i assume obliterating the device would not fix it
plus no passcode since restore is not that impractical
does ramdisk boot not work
just do sep haxx
unset it
and everything back to normal
restore mode is not recovery mode
but restore mode would not be happy
you can
needs some of those
a certain infinite free trial file manager
and ffmpeg and zip and unzip and xz-utils and unrar
you need nano
they are trying to bootstrap rootless
download from internet archive
pinging owner pings no one now
wait loooool aaron does not have owner role
kernel not boot ios 15.5b4
not app container
this is the data container
apparently it is on some coprocessor which is certainly not on the bootrom + some other changes
at least
to make it not work out of the box
it is changed enough
very fr
where is member pro max
im outside
just send me first
for trollbrek
then get clang onto there
procursus
97 mb
how about sandbox
amfi_allow_any_signature=1
not iboot 64 patch
i use kairos
kairos
something like that
kernel 64 patch
no but i can probably make one
i guess i need to disable passcode
gimme
trollbrek
musl libc moment
and only 600 kb big
linux irecovery
i got an actually static
and 15.7rc ipsw is available via dev portal
15.7rc === 15.7
it exists because
siguza is doing stuff
aight it is some other problem then
is app store dead
ok bye
what if you delete the snapshot
cheyote_fake.ipa
open some nuts
elucubratus-rootless
how old is that ss
that happens to depend on them
rest of it is for a certain file manager
or something
and get called as a virus
i believe some tweak tried to use it
ffmpeg is uh
even if not in bootstrap
these are the stuff that needs to work
ffmpeg python3 zip unzip rar unrar libarchive p7zip xz-utils zstd gzip
sign those repos
gpg sign
make sure to uh
semi-heavily
there is only a few packages that are actually used
just set up a barebones bootstrap repo
no need to
what is a rsr
they are semi-kid
nick chan
wen eta
gm alpha
so you can try to turn it to normal
with siri
the solution is to enable voiceover
why expose yourself to dumb stuff
!t blockota
well the oldest non test server anyways
the oldest server that i have is crippled
short answer
because stkc
sileo
it is
which is not the case right now
jb is about to die if most of the discussion is confined to servers like hack different
there are lesson that supposedly ends at 7:20 pm but not today
tried to finished homework
no worries it is 7:31 pm here
im at school
a device can stop receiving updates yet still have updates from some time ago available
also how would blocking updates in stock on devices that no longer receives updates work
it does
is there a modified tvos 16 profile
installer only
it is supported
need vfsdriverkit
is this an oversight
it says ios
most likely legit
probably?
android 12 galaxy s ii
custom roms on android are ok
when will there be hypervisor framework on ios
with a downstream android kernel usb framebuffer and serial port can work, sometimes touchscreen and wifi too.
the open source xnu can't even write to the serial port
at least an android kernel. compiled from source can boot at all i guess
very few drivers are open source
anyways
a small part of the kernel
based on unc0ver 5.3 source code
unc0ver 4.x and above has significant new code stacked on top of the electra base
and not really a fork
odyssey and taurine still have electra references in code but there are much less electra
unc0ver chimera are both electra forks
but the logic is effectively the same
the placement of functions ,and file paths also changed
the strings changed
the function names changed
as well as some strings
the functions are renamed
blizzardjb11 is electra1131 with most functions renamed + an ios 11.4.1 exploit
after some analysis
i know you have ldid.exe
how does the fr part work
and the bypass is flagged on virustotal although the jb exe is not
pr stunt
man figured out how to use libirecovery-utils
sunst0rm but worse
i said it
i need to investigate
is blizzard 11 an electra clone
at least their script got sileo
mineek's script better at this point
that's nathan's sshrd_script
you can uninstall rapid security responses
probably semi tethered
sunst0rm but worse
this is essentially sunst0rm lite
pojavlauncher
time to flex again
!t sepbb
ios 15.7 ipsw
but it is legit iphone 8+
no idea
custom latest
futurerestore
15.7 sep for fr
can you use 15.7 sep
just use futurerestore itself
you are arm64e
status: maybe not ok
idk im on 15.5b4
use a vpn
--use-pwndfu
use pwndfu fr
i think yes
need tweak to get rid of that
tvos profile is probably fine
it's not a secret + it has no creativity in it
curl can be used for piracy too
even though they are not copyrightable
and stealing certs sounds illegal to me
there are other laws
ios 4.2.5
sandcastle pongoos and linux-apple are all cfws
at least according to ghidra
it uses altsign
actual cfw
cfw on iphone
well everything i said are facts but not necessarily in the way you want
for fr
you can use freebsd
and then figure out the libusb driver
then spend 20 hours figuring out how to compile futurerestore
release version is super old
apple maps suck
how many retweets for aaron anime pfp
arsenal must be unrecognizable to mohamed
i should look at zebra for darwin-arm64 first actually
how do i get newterm for darwin-arm64
does not stop the app itself being amazing
though
i have no use out of pojavlauncher
pojavlauncher
this is not a jailbreak.
you should try normal newterm now
wait i mean cylio
sidea for trolls
santander = 7zip
need filza 40 day free trial
ifile
newterm can write to practically everywhere not protected by ssv
newterm
face id
from trollstore
all i know is that i also tried to uninstall springboard
moments before disaster happened
i can still boot ssh ramdisk  on 15 so checkm8 does work
so it could also be other things
ended in the worst way possible
i tried to sideload springboard
what is a torcher
i have 15.5 beta 4
altstore still did not patch my trusted sources bypass
!t latest
arm64 ipas runs on arm64e
i think there is no. piracy
follow the build instructions
i clone their github repo
most yes, but youtube ipa, uyou and openyoutube is not
the youtube ipa definitely piracy though unless you build it yourself
need to check
i think most of it have permission
because of uyou
i mean
i think it is because of the question mark
how is that not filtered
bootrom bug
checkm30 is a real bug
not ios 16, not ios 15
install utm trollstore jit
i need to figure out how to uh
you need to patch the checksum code as  well
just get it from neofetch repo
rose-rom bug
you need
cant compile
u1 compat
you need to compile stuff static
what if there is malware in trollterm
tvos trollstore
i miss mohamed
where is mohamed
trollnonce came just in time for fr lol
what is an i don't upgrade
at this rate fugu15 will be out before anything else
where is ios 16.9
gm aaron
well i guess you can go from 14.5.1 to 14.5
frozen nonce
my blobs: 14.4, 15.5b4, 15.5...
im on 15.5 beta 4
why fr
lost interest what
and it does not count if it doesn't work at all
yeah it. is me
cr4shed
libhooker configurator
cuz i tried
pls don't sideload springboard using trollstore
which is not part of preboot
it is in a dmg
sometimes it reboots right away
actually not at all because launchd
although sshd does run, it sits there doing nothing
ssh is not involved
it's a trollramdisk
because you can patch that check out
operation not permitted
eperm
don't use bootra1n
because other less critical coprocessor firmware
and pop the baseband secure boot while we are at it
attack sep secure boot then
there is a sha3
so it is much harder
in downgrading you can only control one of them
these attack requires you to be able to generate both files that has the same hash
although if you figured out how to be really good at factorization you are not going to use it to downgrade apple devices lol
you either need to be really good at factorization or break the hash algorithm
that's a chosen prefix attack
it isn't a second preimage attack
not quite
how about being good at factorization
and how to define 18
how much am i
in the tether downgrade guide
why is there no mention of mixing coprocessor firmware
launchctl reboot userspace
so probably not much
you on 6s
you always need a blob
and there is a lot of them
for tether downgrade
most of the coprocessor firmware should match the version of the blob you are using
then just do it manually and so you can get support
terminal works on 15.5 beta 4
then do the same as ios 14
install trollstore
ssh ramdisk
santanderescaped
does flower use enmity
i used ipwndfu patch sigchecks
it does not for me either
flower can never be fully understood
and make a release 30 seconds before ios 16
unless checkra1n decides to pull off some black magic
at this point ios 16 is almost certainly going to be released before ios 15 jb
no idea
dfu restore
rip factorydata
very very bad
not iso mode
dd mode
that's fitting for frcoal
did i see a memory editor
me on 15.5b4:
with a ssh ramdisk
and get away with it
and restore
with urandom
you can dd to disk0
or just dd to disk0
ios 15.5 terminal
you can show off
remember to save blobs
javascript is meh
not tested on arm64e
it is all automated now
i helped in making that extra trickery
ios 15 beta
profit
call ptrace(pt_trace_me, 0, 0, 0); in the child process
call posix spawn
minecraft is the thing being jitted
not minecraft
im talking about jit
omg i managed to jit in trollstore
trollstore work
this is like the last build trollstore worked
ok i going to install trollstore
fresh restore
11.3 gb used
!t blockota
where is the profile
ok dreaded beta alert appeared
if the device is already in dfu mode
it should work though?
it should be true
im on the activation lock screen
why is brickstate false
where baseband exploit
baseband
although the end is not exactly normal
i guess it worked
there's no sep nonce setter
i suppose cryptex tickets are already in blobs
futurerestore developer
ok going smoothly
or whatever that's called
i need to capture that brickstate value again
i think the device is going to be icloud locked ... with my own apple id
whatever that is bundled on the iso
default ubuntu usbmuxd works
so i decided to go with that
which implies it is tested the most
most whitenames use ubuntu
sending filesystem
i hope it works
~~should i install buster than try to fr~~
debian stable is old and debian lts is super old
aka super old
debian lts
it is
how can it not work on bullseye then
ci is actually on buster
which *can* cause issues
and the linux build is not completely static
i know debian stable has old libraries
well fr doesn't want to work on debian stable
i think xorg is starting
for fr
and hope it works
reproduce the environment
the ci is on ubunru 22.04 so i need to
debian live took nowhere as long
why does ubuntu live take forever to boot up
im not whitename
im not dumb
i mean 15.5b4
normal blobs in fact
for 15.5b4
i have blob
i don't see an issue with that
jb wise
15.5b4 is 15.4.1 with beta alert
i will do 15.5b4
no blob
unblocked
on that person's messages
btw you can know you are being blocked by reacting
no face id not so much
i can deal with beta alerts
i swear that did something
sideload springboard.app
well 15.5b4 isn't the end of the world
pretty much
and every version on and after 15.5b4
ill restore to 15.5b4 then
the blobs that i have
wait oh no
so i can mess around with mineek's stuff
i think i will go to 15.4.1
actually
but face id breaks
i have blob for all version since
i have a single 14.4 ota blob then the next blob is 15.3.1 normal blob
i bootlooped im trying to fr
on iphone x
i cant decide between 15.4.1 and 14.4
i can't decide
please tell
should i restore 15.4.1 instead
omg why is burning dvds so slow
i mean dvd
ok i start burning the cd
the build is made on ubuntu 22.04 so if i use ubuntu 22.04 it has to work right
screw it
ima use live cd
because pagesize=16384
that system is in itself also cursed
that's my only linux with a really recent userspace
im on debian stable
the build is not 100% static
how fix
device boots to restored external
that's linux but i have macos
it is an ota blob
how fix
i have no.idea how.i did that
im trying to fr
does gaster pwndfu works with fr
there is also 11 blizzard
no it is version specific
and if you sbreload it goes away
it crashes
it makes a springboard app with no icon on the homescreen
did not bootloop
i hope i don't bootloop
k i will try anyways
i don't want bootloop
what happens if i install springboard.ipa with trollstore
ok bye
jbinit hooks launchd
why not do it like jbinit
you need to do something to get it to persist
the postinst script did it
launches jb daemons
launchd_replacement.c
i think
making the device think it is in restore mode
i think it breaks adapters
i think jbinit writes to the rootfs
just no renaming
cuz making the device think it is in restore mode is problematic
how about md0 to dd0 checks
is it based on jbinit
need stuff running on boot
(unc0ver 14.6-14.8 does have krw just a private api)
need some sort of krw for real jb
like the matches and masks
i have no idea how to patch that
how about task for pid
are you just using kernel 64 patch
need rootless cydia
does task for pid 0 work
posix spawn
amy's fix
how did you fix
my brain is going to shut down
since the slave device has an internal battery
it does not look like it would need a lot of power
pongoterm ios no work with an unpowered adapter
emacs isn't even in main procursus
it is also iphoneos-arm64 arch
how do i make my brain function correctly
it is 2:08 am
how do i process stuff correctly
and jump back to yourself
after loading the kernel and stuff
you patch iboot
somewhere in the bootchain
because it is supposed to be ran on the device
you don't
and the userspace kernel patcher only runs on arm64 darwin
but it does not write the kernel afterwards
they are only in memory patches
there is kpf-test too
average ame and bre moment
look at console.app
because i realized a potentially non-fatal mistake
that's fake linus
or smth
did not generate wrapped keys
isn't that when
it exists
this looks wrong
right?
right
send log
does procursus sudo work
exists
com.apple.private.security.no-container
really random error
run that in terminal i guess
i think you are launching the wrong sileo
using the right sileo
it is already set to the expected value
i can try
lightning to sim tray adapter
it can replace any app store app
i think
should i just upload that here
i compiled sileo
and the icon looks like play store
i should generate debug sileo build
kill finder
for checkm8
tweaks
then why not tweaks
plz support tfp0
got some stuff to do
after 30 minutes
i mean i can actually start compiling it
wait caps lock
hey i can compile sileo in about 30 mins
so make an infinite kill loop
futurerestore hates finder
afterwards
remember to get rid of the bash loop
just use sed
in the source tree
and i think you need to do it on practically every file
and change some paths
13.2.1 can work
i think
hackintosh
you need xcode 13.4
sileo should be not too hard i think?
that futurerestore supposedly is using
it can claim the usb interface
after apple logo with progress bar shows up you can cancel the bash loop
while true; do killall -9 finder; sleep 0.5;done
kill finder in a bash loop and try again
wait what os is this
is this a build from github actions
i mean rick
omg it is gir
spawn a virtual cpu with the hypervisor than jit there
well on m1 ipads anyways
checkra1n does not work on ios 15
leaving in 5 seconds
fakebsd
like u-boot
suggest something more realistic
linux works on a4
every chipset beside t2 and a9  reported to work
how run linux a9
someone go run newterm 15.5b4
iphone 2g does not suck on iphone os 2
iphone 2g
as newterm
i think it needs the same degree of modification
because it runs a daemon
would need some slight modifications
it uh
for stuff to sanely work
libhooker
logos has to support
or just reprovision
and sileo
not everyone care about tweaks
so it is objectively worse than sunst0rm
except that this time geo calls it a jb
man remade sunst0rm tether boot
normal odysseyn1x
rick is always worth saying gm to
ew just use dpkg
i think yes
make sure to enable untethering
make sure you use altstore too
omg flower hi
no idea
ios 15
rename rootfs snapshot
also omg breaking tos
webhook?
what do you want to do
omg flower on jailbreakooc
"betas that apple has deleted from their cdn"
ok bye
there are code to handle ios 16 only stuff
by your logic it would also confirm 16
dick pics
how about dp in cheyote
please no
but does not know it exists on that version
in the 13.5 case the manufacturer knows about the exploit
unpatching sock puppet and lightspeed
10 minutes
because it cannot release after eol
before december 2026
windows drivers
it is
i think it is
a16 is armv9?
never
many people
use irc
detour + modern stuff = all bets are off about whether certain behaviour is trolling
not really
ok bye
failed to reboot system: 154: requestor is not a platform binary
trolled
or an if statement
or a for loop
that means you did not close a quote
newterm sucks its only purpose. is to get telnetd to run
and arguments
to spawn the shell at that location
well it needs to be patched
has these entitlements
every binary
stoarge entitlements
the entitlements
ssh ramdisk
hydrate
you probably can use ssh ramdisk to install trollstore on 15.5b4
arm64?
there are two partitions on the disk
also this do not works although i'm never expecting this to work
only last partition shows up on 14.4
how do i access all the partition with supported filesystem on a usb on an iphone
ok bye
there are also ios 16 stuff
so letting pongo to continue when that not work sounds bad
trustcache patch not working = codesign patch not working
why is trustcache patch optional in latest pongo commit
rooting from the live fs of a sealed volume is not allowed on a release build
you can work on amfid bypass later
coretrust bypass is more stable
turns out you can log jailbreak detection using console.app on macos
it says com.apple.restored_external here
congrats to them elevating to the level of everyone else
now install with ssh ramdisk on 15.2-15.5b4
ssh ramdisk trolling
in fact i installed trollstore without the installer
dynamic codesigning not working on 14 jailed
that just means checkra1n team is taking way too long
someone should try installing trollstore in 15.5b4 a8-a11
14.8 does not exist for a15
i think only the steps after reset matters
with irecovery -c reset
to enter dfu
in my experience 0.5 seconds in is enough
debug yourself with task_for_pid-allow and get-task-allow
it only exists on my mac and iphone
you don't
modded newterm
photo booth
newterm worked with trollstore
what do i do next
im trying to get dropbear to work
switched to hardware because files in preboot keep disappearing
newterm needs special setup though
they all work fine under trollstore
it is bugged partly because newterm 3 itself is bugged
newterm trollstore
ssh ramdisk magic
trollterm
newterm trollstore
what device
what ios
now i have little reasons to use altstore
unjailbroken trollstore, ios 14.4, iphone x, ssh ramdisk install
how can rom run in el0
so still valid
then it is a logic bug in firebloom
there are only exception levels
there are no rings
there is no kernel in bootrom
memo?
and then only logic bugs can happen
probably coming with a16
homepod
see it is really bad
you should see this bad photo
12.5-12.5.4 has the same kernel version
in 12.5.6
kernel version changed
ios 12.5.6
ok bye
what free xp
i checked sbapptags and there is no hidden proeprty
uiopen works
i installed it
how do i make the compass app show up on ipad
how do i spoof location with xcode
so i get untethered calculator
time to resign it with that coretrust cert
this is so cursed
found it
where is calculator.app on the rootfs
sideloadly
appstore++
bootloopxx
idk if that will work because dyld shared cache
im going to try install the ios calculator on ipad
app store apps must be decrypted
well icloud bypass discussion isn't allowed here anyways
except that it is bundled with malware (note the jailbreak .exe itself probably is not, virustotal did not detect that)
ra1npoc windows in essense
ibss.idk.release.im4p
you need im4p files
probably
ios 15 ota
let me guess
so that you can generate img4
to generate an im4m
remember you also need to patch ibss
any blob would do
get a blob
in ipsw
there are only im4p
how did you make ibss.img4
nvm discord search revealed it
who is samara
is it pwned dfu
you didn't say pwned dfu
that matches the ecid and nonce
signed with valid im4m
you need to send img4
a9x and below would need ibec after ibss
i mean what i said
because it is a9x or older
well gm to certain people on a list
very real
because i want to say gm
because it is very easy to get stress here
only to leave soon after
iphone 4
activate mobile obliterator
average ota experience
yeah flower is patient
just be patient
what rebooted again
what is a goinf
all i did is deleting repos from piracy list
i contributed to canister
canister exists
unlike the eta when reinstalling macos in recovery
this timer is usually quite accurate
ex: unc0ver
facts:
cheyote
end of life
actually before december 2026
you know you can always use gpg
because galaxy nicked theirselves nick chan
im talking to zeta
where signed_ctzn.txt
bored
omg it is oneinanull
maxcpus=1
then use an actual ubuntu usb
is this like a super new pc
how about itunes
does it works on iphone os 1
append the 2fa code to the password
apple provides a way to use 2fa on them
hi taurine+fugu14 person
see how much $
apple store repair
the stuff behind it is not
so only like the glass of the screen is damaged
how much for apple store repair
press the home button
make a mempro-general and this server would seem better
launchctlderp
what should i tweet on my alt twitter account
not faster
it worked
i ran your script on macos
something like that
jelbrek not working
i need to improve it
terrible script
taunc0ver
check your issues tab
missing spaces
because it doesn't work with bash 3.2
1. get a device on ios 14.3
idk i can't even compile normal taurine
2. it doesn't work properly
1. it is not mine
cuz that's before i figured that i will replace launchd
so it is already late boot when it is ran
analyticsd+fileproviderctl
that implementation is
and i get taurine splash bfu
so it is even longer
in that implementation you need to run the exploit for two times
it is just super slow
and about untethered i already sort-of-figured that out on 14.3
on 14.3
sounds more realistic to modify taurine instead
does not work as is
idk the untethered bad apple one
same effect as u0+fugu14 to the end user
will persist
most notably certain ota blocking methods
some stuff would still persist
i have like 4 school email addresses
raid0?
when upload 1 pb
turns out i can use the build script for a youtube ipa to generate an ipa with the same feature as the pirated ipa without piracy
the rule 5 exe is flagged by many vendors, but the jailbreak exe is not
you are detecting the wrong .exe
and sep is certainly going to be incompatible when 15.5b4 gets a semi-untethered jailbreak
then the next blob is 15.5b4
is 14.4
the oldest blob i have for that a11 device though
both gets 16
and screw it i have a9x and a11
confirmed that jailbreak is too late to release for futurerestore to work if the device receives latest updates
all my devices are on 14
like me
and you can do that unlimited when jailbroken
technically sideload tweaking still works
it uses libusbmuxd
it does not appear to be malware
it is a string in the installer
bullfrogassistant.app
now grab me the ipa
how would you spoof location njb without ddi
please check if this tool has piracy'
font issue
they have port 22 open
ssh-2.0-openssh_8.2p1 ubuntu-4ubuntu0.5
well any path besides a blank one works
how do i know if something is ansiette
just the name of the company
gm copypasta
give ipa
throw the exe into ghidra
what's in profile and device management
you can bypass wifi sync restrictions to localhost with a vpn
prolly normal apple id cert
virustotal didn't detect it at least
gircock
qemu-t8030 wiki exixts
works fine for 14
doesn't really work correctly for 15
won't work at all with ios 16 or 13
booting ios on ios
ive did it before
quite difficult to run qemu-t8030 on ios
you mean corellium at home
procursus is more likely to break than elucubratus because more packages and more updates
does sound like a procursus moment
then `sudo apt install -f` again
`sudo dpkg --force-all -r libtiff`
i have an idea
sudo apt remove libtiff libgd3 libnginx-mod-http-image-filter
sudo apt install libgd3
sudo apt remove libtiff libgd3
that's another issue
or so you think
ez fix
uninstall libtiff
that's libgd3 depends on libtiff5
afaik i previously have some issue with libtiff5 where it is automatically removed as all of its files are replaced by other packages
sounds difficult to spell stuff right in a panic attack
that's a general procursus error
they are at least 50-
their previous actions should be enough to hint at this
because they are completely unsuited for 21st century internet
not impossible
panic attack
a4 boot fix a9 init fix
how about armv7s
real?
fugu14 has a real ui
that works
they need it for demo
there has to be a ui
how about sighza
ok cool
they need to figure out how to actually jailbreak
and ipa decryption
and unlimited sideload
and youtube tweaks
and snowboard theme
release-unc0ver-within-1000-seconds-of-fugu15-release-challenge
i think it is 26th already even in utc-12
i have real manticore ipa
there's literally no working untethered exploits for 12-13
gcc 6 not work
cydia on studio display
how do i link 42 devices to havoc
but non-root on xnu can use most low ports
well, certain ports a blacklisted
ios allows low ports
no idea
not true
so is millions of other people with the same pfp
checkra1n
linux-apple
i need to wait for it to arrive
because openiboot works
at least my toolchain is not completely broken
how fix idroid-kernel
guess i need to use sideloadly
includes macos?
if i rip an ipa off a device without decrypting, i should be able to use it on another device with same apple id right
the number is critical for me
it breaks the notification badge, it does not show the number
also, it literally tells your right above
found a level-3-filtered word
now wait for 2147483647 seconds
when install it on m1
yeah a chimera
uses apk-tools on the user side but have no relation to alpine beyond that
bsd llvm musl on top of linux
var is noexec and rootfs is ro
no access control beyond posix permissions
it is not very common though
it could use exploits
every jailbroken ios is rooted
not that it is good
substitute updates
despite the lack of communication
that would also mean the unc0ver is doing stuff more recently
launjctl
caffeinate is a no-op on ios
running on s5l8930
a4 is armv7
armv6
from ibss
pongo needs support for ibec entry point fr
on checkra1n ios 15
because llb stuff broken
openiboot work
how run linux a4
it just reboots randomly
mine does not
for an iphone 4
random reboots
instability
pangu7 is my first jb
launchctl
that's 257 bytes
so that they can ignore it
they get included in analytics logs
they have
yes discord does detect jb
like discord's jb detection
and only include the information in stuff like analytics
ehh id say any detection should not have an effect on the user
doesn't prevent badly written jailbreak detection from triggering from ota though
ssv will kill it
it can be read write right before an ota
because preboot can be either read only or read write in stock mode
actually wouldn't be a problem
ehhh just mount an (obviously blank) tmpfs over it then
erofs vs eperm -
i need to finish my enrollment  procedure
i mean a future version of vnode will probably do that
but i guess you can also delete that symlink
dualboot bypass
and stuff
im setting up my school email
just do it in class
why not
openiboot
eh it is fine
+unreadable characters to you
it is removed now
watch as someone tries to pr it into piracy list again sometime later
aaaannnnndddd it is gone from piracy list
although reading is really hard for a lot of people in this case
went through every package to confirm no piracy or dangerous stuff
submitted canister pr
some packages has the name of certain knows tweaks as part of the name and people automatically assumed it is piracy
mistake
people really doesn't verify stuff before adding repo to lists
reading is hard (appearently)
come on
just locale files
it doesn't contain the tweak itself
it isn't piracy lol
delta?
wrong bin
wrong binary
try again
how did it work before then
the load address seems to be a bit too... low?
waaaaaiiit
is there command to load a fdt
of linux
well it probably died in head.s
serial port
fun fact earlycon=s3c2410,0x82500000 console=ttysac0 is a thing
5.3-rc6
i know of another kernel port
debian testing?
idk some random armv8.5 sbc
i just used a modern aarch64 system
gcc 6 it is then
compiling linux 3.0.8 with gcc 10 may not have been the best idea
wen dcsd
stuck on booting linux
let me guess
`wait_boot 1000`
`initrd`
now upload the initramfs
openiboot console?
check the expect script i sent you
oops wrong command
cc -os oibc.c -lpthread -lreadline -lusb-1.0 -o oibc
cc -os oibc.c -lpthread -lreadline -lusb1.0 -o oibc
compile oibc.c
just use blobs
resend
increase your boot time
ubuntu 12.04 lts build experience be like:
send image
you still have that?
kextlog=0xffff
whatever you did before
i send new bin
openiboot
youtube ipa is not allowed
may work?
removing clang deleted the shell on elucubratus
is there an error message
and imcomplete
to emulate
ps3 would be slow asf
reboot and try again
now try not to reboot the device
eh pretty much
in reality it is negligible
well, theoretically anyways
choosing no saves battery
hi super user
i think a 10 times overhead
they are emulated though
dumping from actual hardware is the only way supported here
and firmware files
then your home screen should be changed
without respiring
it should apply
and the restore system button in the app removes most jailbreak files
now get and run this shortcut
!t shortcut
remember substrate doesn't work correctly
don't open it
you must not use usb c cables
connect it again
disconnect the device
pop up
very real
and malware
at least a custom usb backend and a checkra1n.dmg uploader
there are some custom code added in -
in terms of jailbreaking
15.0-15.6.1 doesn't really make too much difference for air 2 i think
where hydration twitter
ok i fixed it
init_libxpwn is called without arguments
wait i see why
lol why is argc 0x1
openiboot moment
why is it trying to access null + 1
how do i make mk8900image from openiboot run on a system with a pagesize of 16384
how to generate libxpwn.a
they are getting random commits and idroidproject.org somehow decided that it should be up
actually the other one is 5 apr 2022
last commit is 2019
this claims to have a fix for the panic
i need to somehow make it compile
macos
a reddit post said you must use ios 4
python 2
i need to grab ubuntu 12.04 lts
i need to figure out how to compile openiboot first
ftl is nand stuff
i can look into disabling nand
openiboot
and wrapped in img3
is it patched ibss
how you boot
loadibec somehow needs libcurl
im building libcurl
maybe i can make a binary
wait what os
you need to link irecovery
with clang
use normal dfu mode
not that one
this is the correct loadibec
with kloader
what if you load openiboot
how does it not work
and send it
what if you wrap it up in an img3
use ipwndfu
do pwned dfu
raw file
flat armv7 executable image
i think
flat image
you don't
it exists up until a4 except s5l8922
please ignore the version number
they will not have hypervisor.framework
in terms of support
ios 12 is same as ios 14
they aren't
call dpkg to restore rootfs
try 127.0.0.1
the tcp port is open
i suppose you can
then you use iboot32patcher to patch iboot
to deal with img3
you use xpwntool
based
and 32 mb of storage
i have vi on a system with 4 mb of ram
no reason
not on my checkra1n ramdisk
it bundles pico
macos do not bundle nano
uw pico 5.09
anything but vim
in any other environment you would use nano or something else
in embedded you would use vi
vim is ew
well at least you now have idea what kind of system is this
why is a server running bleeding edge software
dnf exists
gm aaron
just cat os-release
what is this system
write launchctl.c
cuz java moment
aka pretty much every android app
as opposed to elf executables
how much overhead does java create on android
idk how much
it is better than electron
hi moderators
wdym non broken
the uefi specification states that the firmware should work without any efi variables
needed to tweak direct system calls
memory patching
does zefram support patching
you can just make sure you are accessing the right file
not necessarily
no need to touch zefram itself
just make a zefram tweak that adds it
make substrate compat
error message truncation detected! cannot proceed
memory pages containing machine code
a custom one
already have one
brb cracking discord
where
der entitlements
resign it using new ldid
resign it
and it is an app-based tweak
it could work if you dump the dylib
because jit
just do linux
regression testing
sorry i mean checkra1n guy
how about checkra1n team
unc0ver_memo
pretty much
change every procursus in source code to something else
call it unc0ver bootstrap
fork procursus
that works up until a9x
second preimage
crack sha1
bug in button press parsing logic
geosn0w is ok ish
he still manages to somehow extract info from pwn
it was down for a few years
use disk1
tweaks that tweak the package manager
i think they mean
you use img4tool
i compiled idroid kernel
jre would do
that makes sense to me
well discounting betas
there are 5 versions with apfs
late 10 has apfs
does coolbooter support apfs
dualbootfun is less steps
you need to create partitions anyways
why stash files when you can just make the partition a bit bigger
s5l8900 and s5l8920 exists
what if the only thing that works is uart and the display
cuz that is certainly possible
ima research that a bit
archive.org
i do believe it is pup at bset malware at worst
all it show is the log url
frankly that post doesn't prove much
i have nsa software on my pc
is nsa software any better than ida pro
piracy type=apple internal
launchctl
piracy detected
you need a patched sdk
remember to define _xopen_source
probably
you try to compile
what program
to hook printf
how to use libhooker in c
when will ios correct ios to android
macintosh
noooo
i think some firmware are verified by the coprocessor
compile as root
like uh
on the rootfs
so flower is patient
is two tempset cores
i think the isp coprocessor on m1
that was isp
i forgot what exactly but i think the dcp got some pretty powerful cores
apple need to actually make use the the dma whitelist ability of the hardware
huh so the bug is not on the dcp
as well as choosing to expose the dcp directly to userspace
but then if you do stuff from dcp you basically just bypasses ppl
i mean
it is
i think the dcp can dma whatever physical memory it wants
not every ios version fix security issues
eh every version has at least 100 0 days anyways
something went wrong
speaking of that masterofmike is still somehow in my trash discord server
heh flower collected all of their besties in their secret
that means you need your besties
in what ways
at the time of writing
nonexistent
wwtc 21 is lackluster
where is wwtc 22
ios 16.0b1 is sydneyseed
check the ramdisk name
supercharge
token
please give
in 1 second
ive seen battery go from 1% to 70%
i lost bootloop me mobileconfig
!t blockota
their password is 1
how about sichuan university
what does it do
not self explanatory enough
not really
what does discordbegone do
there are exactly 2 dots in a non 2fa token
non 2fa tokens does not look like this
what if no 2fa
how though
i like flowers
undefined
i like flower
i need to print the call stack that make me into a not fine state
status: not fine
aka banned for doing nothing
not the most funny person
it is literally identical
because it is fully invalid right now
they really should be
can usb 1.1 run over usb-c
n1ck right now:
and what to audit
how do i audit nick chan
and audit the cpu design
you need to audit the os the compiler is running on
still works
check whether that nonce setting webhook
i need to
technically it is
not that it is happening though
even without enmity
all it does is reposting message
or a build override on desktop
well it is going to be insta claimed by bots
discord desktop is just a site specific browser
nah it is a link on my console
that makes 0 sense
and elucubratus is 2
how is havoc 1
what determine rankings
elucubratus is 2
procursus has ranking 1
packix ranking is 2
what does ranking mean
wow worf finally sent message here
not the greatest current but should do
you do realise you can charge stuff with pc
modify the software to ignore certain smc pmu signals
no way that will be louder
not happening
you won't die
no they won't
does that work
im not gay
please elaborate
idk about 7
ubuntu
how to get xp faster
you should look at youtube
i think netboot+debug maybe better
pmos_continue_boot moment
carrier name:
ios 13 baseband
i think force revert work with passcode on
force revert
sandcastle is a pr stunt
do you think
there
i think it is just a random crash
did usb come up
ramdisk booted fine on a9x
what kind of ramdisk
gm rick
no liquid
if there is in fact
emergency override
wen jb
not required
i can send you all of them
something like that
you should do it
what are you going to do if launchd dies
you also need to change the dts
implement a secondary cpus in pongo then put them spinning in a loop
messing with pongo is more enjoyable
iokit.dll
it uses iokit everywhere
you need to modify the source code
how does it fail
and this is not hypothetical
there are hardware that both macos and linux does not like
redacted showed us that is very much possible
better add an overlay uploader too
how about ra1npoc.exe on windows
so gaster.exe needs driver
but stuff like ssh and substrate all died
the kernel patches remain
serial=3
in a userspace reboot
so fake launchd will end up being executed
actually that may be due to snowboard?
so app store still works
because there are no dylibs to regenerate it
dyld shared cache
it is a cache though
so you have to rely on the cache
worth doing badly iphone os application signing
parental controls
dyld shared cache contains n word
n word
there are filtered words in dyld shared cache
aka 490 microseconds
should be 0.00049 seconds
8 and 0 is difficult to distinguish
wait nvm
init is alive for exactly 0.00121 seconds
ehhh it is ok ish with ios 12, i think
if you look at the threadtime, init is alive for exactly 0.00008 seconds
and that is also static
and checkra1n will extract a third during execution
well there are two executables
every executable is static
on the checkra1n initrd
checkra1n initrd?
you want initrd?
with the normal linux-apple pongo
speaking of that i crashed 6 times in a row today
changing to load address
there is a grand total of 2 userspace process running on that checkra1n ramdisk
i have no cable
it's 90% of ios code
init.c
and yes the colours are skewed
but is not gibberish either
hi i am nick chan
segmentation fault
checkra1n no usb
there is a way to make checkra1n.efi though
how about i make checkra1n.efi
welcome to checkra1n!
appinst
can you read
there are other ways to display image other than uiimage i think
i think a lot of it is from j's binbag
2006 bash
this tweak drains battery
one of them is the installation log
idk which image is what they are all fr to me
worked
just compile caffeinate
repo died
stat somefile.deb
aren't you using apt ftparchive
we need open source com.nathan.fr
just checksum them on the 4s
taurine-permanent-fr.deb
com.nathan.fr
im not behaving quite like galaxy
nofreeapplimit is ok
openpwnage 64
boot linux on 42 devices
ooc hack different
so no untether
both of the non-legacy untether bugs does not work on 12-13
ios 12 & 13 is the next worst version for untether after 15 & 16
pretty sure you can
it will watchdog timeout
ipod touch 4
eh, yes, logic bugs
so if the dcp is exploited you theoretically can do the jailbreak from there
the ios 14 kernel quite literally allows the dcp to map whatever physical memory it wanted
i think it is 2 vortex cores
also the dcp is pretty op for a display coprocessor i think
so they are aware of ipads not being supported
in that super short release note
they specifically mentioned a12-a13 iphones
jailbreak dcp
you get code execution on the processor that controls the framebuffer just like on a12-a13
the exploit can be modified to work on them
did it support 14.7 betas
maybe hardcoded offsets ?
if you only allow new models
mac pro, i guess
how would they tell
e.g 2 can be bluetooth
and both of these can be satisfied without jb but no implementation
this is one of the theoretically doable without jb but no implementation thing
cydia is quite literally an electron app before electron existed
there are dev firmware for savage
yonkers.1a01_2a01_2201_3201_dev.fw
and you can't download it from apple
that's a pulled build
pulled
internet archive moment
i finally found iphone13,1_14.6_18f5046e_restore.ipsw
skull
repo issues
just sideload the ipa using altserver sideload
altstore doesn't work on ios 9
altstore isn't going to work, use altserver
it can access any iouserclient
the control set up with macos host works
you think i didn't try google
there are no devices in lsusb
golden jb version
ipados 14.3
nothing shows up in lsusb even when the android is in download mode (where it should be in device mode) so
yeah tapping on that doesn't give any options
wtf the android is in host mode even if it is in recovery
maybe that is easier
maybe i try mess with developer options on the android and force that into device mode instead
i can't even test fastboot because this android does not support it
both devices supports usb otg so it should be doable
how do i reverse the modes
when connecting an android and ipad
how to make ipad the host
i can't figure out
flower is a good stkc replacement
flower can be stkc
as the carrier name
what is that tweak the puts the local ip address
instead of host mode
suggesting that it is in device mode
this ipad is drawing power from android
how do i force usb host mode on ipad
rebuilding android-tools for ios
this sounds illegal
a9 init fix
trollage
how do i add more slices
there are some nextstep slices
there are 1337 archs in that macho
you don't
get that macho
you don't
you haven't seen my macho yet
while still be able to use the original function
do you think you can hook imagewithcontentsoffile
now make taurine untether
how about armv6
arm64e
you should make vidoes fr too
is it a fat tweak
fr tweak?
are not fr
app icons
then manually update the cert
http+no gpg
where
how does settings look like
is every image fr
blocking boot until jailbreak is done sounds like a bad idea
haxx does not block boot
not launchd
you can do it in haxx
wdt=-1
nebula arm reveal
checkra1n on nommu linux on cortex m0 with 16 mb of ram
ra1npoc on cortex-m0
i mean like this
although even that is a bit flaky
it works in linux
codesign -s - --force --deep ra1npoc_macosx
run xattr -cr ra1npoc_macosx on the destination machine
sign it without entitlements
upload checkra1n.dmg
you can make ra1npoc
do you think
it quite literally steals the checkra1n ramdisk
it is though
that tells you how to downgrade on iphone
i think there is a whole page
more attack surface!!!!
well not exactly dfu
but they did it in apple watch
when ibus transceiver s7
s6 and s7
ibus s6
not recovery mode
wait dumbma member edition
launchd jb
make jb?
it is on the mainboard
that will output logs to the serial port
hijacking dsc or dyld doesn't work
serial=3
this breaks taurine btw
the fact that it booted at all
omg red framebuffer
or something
would't stuff like this be in syscfg
what kind of setup is this
so how does this happen
ie_sex
or substitute and libiosexec
like libkrw and libiosexec
literal how
subcursus
is this
it has shims related to ssh passwords in it
libiosexec is a shim stash right now
go ahead make it into libiosexec
idk i use tigervnc
it is a matter of compiling stuff
vnc works on macos at least
wait i mean android-tools
my only open pr
i think it is the platform tools pr
i spent some 6 (?) hours on it
please
i think you should go and close them
all your prs are broken in one way or another
red special or something
you need to remove the gui
on reboots
i think the socket path change
make it print no bitches ascii art
look at launchd.c
do i make a launchd plist that launches a program that chmods the socket
how to get dbus to work across reboots
id recommend changing the twitter profile first
rare natalie appearance
unless you are trying to re
blue becomes red
like green becomes yellow
maybe an upstream update broke it
t2 is also broken, but eh
a9x work
ipad pro 9.7 inch
khtml is from scratch
from scratch
everything is a fork of khtml
it is just abuse
it isn't an exploit
there are fiber in my apartment
maybe parts of the wire is not fiber?
2g has way more bandwidth than that
2g has a longer wavelength
iphone 4
yes with another cable
rarely longer
data pins are usually shorter or same length
i finally found about why my dts wasn't working
if these two conditions satisfied at the same time people would explode
does tr1 really
you told people to die?
syntax error
in a dts file
i can't find where i did wrong
in case of cheyote
and there are always other factors stalling it for even longer
and for unc0ver, well it is *cannot be determined*
eh not really, procursus macos existed
that did not stall a bit from ssv
not cheyote though
maybe it stalled checkra1n for a bit
can confirm
ssv is not a big issue because there is no need to even attempt to violate it
amd mobile is basically amd laptops
that's like of least concern
checkra1n works ok on amd mobile
k fine
ios 15
arm64 on1x
because accounts
they can be worked around
nathan's chat is not responding
not because of the 4s
i think it is just nathan's bad internet
even if it is slow
ehhh a 4s should handle 10 requests fine
the websocket is hanging
why isn't nathan's chat working
nathan 4s chat

yeah i can  confirm galaxy is a important person
for real
i like it
been a while
reboot ,enable log window, try again
what is flame
can confirm
use taurine
14.3 best
i mean typescript
how about typoscript
html is markup
checkra1n
apple cloth firmware 15.5
and checkra1n a7 is trash on linux
i suppose this advantage does not include running fuos
just don't use pacman
making an alt  as you said is more effort imo
it isn't really effort
better do it rootless too
why not use apt on watchos
it is dead
as well
there's no bootstrap
skull
snoolie is typing
i did not mention icloud
you can also use this method to get to google without completing setup
to do that on a watch
or smth
you would need a captive portal
not like that
or armv7k
also gm
member edition
not on its own
please ignore the way i wrote the commit message
please gitignore them
omg i find hydrati0nman
launchctl load -w plist
please don't use systemctl syntax on launchctl
because jit
still use webkit

how fix
gui for tq pre jailbreak
error this type of interaction is masked
install nothing
does manticore look like that
does sms work
get on telegram
status: not ok
does stkc still responses
omg it is stkc
wrong width
how about like this
build 170
i have a build of checkra1n that is in between versions
checkra1ninternal
rjailbreakinternal
galaxyinternal
pretty much
i compile stuff
someone in checkra1n team decided that
someone removed the check
i have adb compiled for ios
unc0ver root apk
apple external
i have to post this
you also need to add a overlay uploader
too slow
and it is kind of screwed up when an icloud bypass team beat checkra1n to it
and a gui
it is a recompiled ra1npoc with a custom overlay uploader
iredacted
flower
at least it can do what files app can
ish better
that means more work
omg it is not ephemeral
for framebuffer
there was a device that need offset 12
10 bit framebuffer
a9 seems to crash more than a9x (?)
and a9x
all i know is that it compiles
that it crash
i have no idea
100% crash rate
remember when the load address is changed
i made a fix for a9x
and it should work on a7-a8, a10-a11
borked pongo
why does odysseyn1x have linux-apple
so it becomes what you get when you tether down without replacing firmware
like hapticengine
just mitigate it in every coprocessor with signed firmware
watch as checkra1n source code got leaked
checkra1n.tar.gz
oneweirdtrick.pdf
the release of checkm8 is very much meant for jbs
checkra1n exists
it can
a jailbreak exploit
it can be
earlycon serror fix
dfu ipsw
was thinking about the green icon next to it
why does reserving the bottom 512 mb of ram make pongo crash
a9 init fix
14.8 userspace better than 14.7
are you using a 14.8.1 kernel
why not 14.8.0.5
i saw pcr test somewhere
what app is this
yeah you need to further infer it other than the literal meaning
could also refer to manga
pretty much, anime characters are two dimensional
it needs to be further inferred
well this is what it says literally
the first one is 2 dimensional
im really bad at reading this character set
sorry
and 200 mb of free ram is good enough for both of the apps
this is rather important because this device only has 881 mb of ram
down to around 681 mb
i managed to get the memory usage of android on homecsreen
press on the eye icon next to the hidden app
select hidden protected apps
select home screen settings
long press on the home screen
there are hidden apps
can i repost androids here
omg no more android girl
hydration
when hapatictouch exploit
pwned
to make a device fully game over
that means they need to be pwned too
whatever stuff that does not work when tethered down
how many firmware are in the firmware folder
it is certainly more than ap+sep+baseband
how many chips do i need to pwn to fully make a device game over
no one has managed to demote sep using blackbird yet
ap demotion
it is called demotion
effective approductionmode mode can be 0 on production devices
it is just a statement
and approductionmode specific
darwin kernel version -99.-99.-99
even on ios
linux method would be on every non macos
default sunst0rm will be used on macos
i wrote js before
it couldn't be too hard
i think i should try anyways
i have no idea how to write python
you restore kasan?
checkra1n load_linux dhcpcd
you don't have it anyways
who is isuns9
why not patch restoretrustcache
also you can patch ramdisk on linux confirmed
where
how patch libimg4
cheyote will probably be like u0+fugu14
syscfg is dead
now that restored had ran
i suppose there are actually filesystem on the disk now?
restored_external64patcher
can you patch restored external
so restoresep works
for 13.2.3
fdr error
send log
a feature on apple silicon mac
just a boolean flip
or something
and it just hook a single function
you decompiled springboard??
how to prove
interesting
omg what is flower.app
and the ios 14 equivalent is a taurine ripoff (no additional information available)
the ios 13 equivalent is an odyssey ripoff with elucubratus
redacted stuff
hammer jb
or make ipwndfu-t8030
it is possible if you just drop a say ios 15.6 jailbreak out of nowhere
if i get enough underration it will happen
i need to build up the massive underration
if i ever get dev it would be advanced dev
not without advanced dev
never
multi touch kernel exploit jailbreak when
and checkra1n team is softer on that front than unc0ver team
checkra1n has a non zero chance of using procursus because nitotv is so dead
by applying voltage on force dfu pin while spamming dfu aborts over usb
yeah that takes about 8 months
ibridge1,1
reenter dfu 2 billion times
get nvme usb and framebuffer to work
use a usb hub connect ethernet mouse and keyboards
it is asahi btw
3 downstream usb ports
there are 1 input usb port
so we can put linux on it
we need to figure out how to use checkm8 on a13
tethered downgrade also needs additional ramdisk patches which futurerestore does not provide
it is for tethered downgrades
unplug it during an update
such a jump is possible just not with ota
need to steal a lot of defines from apple opensource
i compiled kernel64patcher on linux
so capt stop trying
whitename tricks literally don't work on linux users
that's the trickest part by far
i mean patching files on linux
to see if it can be done
if they are using linux your usual whitename tricks are much more likely to fail
checkra1n used that to create the 1mb ramdisk on linux
is not
raw hfs
do you have any blobs for that iphone 8
buy another device
technically sep can work on a10 tether downgrade if a valid 14.8.1 blob is used
so funny
cursed
yeah that kernel version is 14.8.1
how did you make springboard work
did you boot with checkra1n
is this 14.8.0.5
to tether downgrade
unless you use a 14.8.1 blob
oh wait
lte advanced is 4g
lte is 3g
lte is 3g
i have no idea why
well a8x
the last processor it worked on
we need kloader so we can boot linux on a12-a13
you need a ktrr+amcc bypass for a11
and it is
coolbooter
people do semi-untethered downgrades
tethered dualboot downgrades
tethered upgrades
how about secondary threads
aka dualboot
we need semi-tethered downgrades
flower is undefined
congrats you just describing passing though usb controller
you need to pass through the usb controller
it compiles
pmset ios no work
cameren is just being real
and guam
and alaska and hawaii
in the us
there are like 4 timezones
it patches some security issues
the kernel is certainly different
mismatching userspace and kernel
and i think the second kernel is only used when you tether boot
divise is dual boot
it also restores the kernel
this is a very cursed setup aimed at making pongoos work
on 14.8.0.5
how did you get sb to launch
skull
test tweak on versions
secondary device
debugging
most likely thing own is going to do
between 15.6 and 15.1
if you can tether downgrade there is no real difference
bundle entire internal rootfs in ipsw when
when will apple do that to a dmg
16.0b4 ota
does dev iboot still exists
there is no know kasan xnu 8792 ios
you need to use 15.1b3 kernel
kernelcache development
if you have another device tether boot 15.0
i have 0 idea
huh ok
galaxy is merged 14.8.1 (valid) + 14.8 right now
what is a fud
frmiddle
i can see why
trolla
flower needs hearing assistance
need a good flower
an upstream maintainer gets confused because no actual real code are added beside ifs
also in this case adding support means if-ing out existing code
i still have no idea how did linux managed to not boot on a9(x) at all
com.apple.private.skip-library-validation
other than resigning springboad with that funny entitlement
i have no idea how to make it work under checkra1n
can you tether boot with 14.8 components
i need a beerpsi sighting
shitc0ver.dev
we need shitc0ver back
skull
it is legal if it is published via official update channels
they are in the ios 14.0b5 ipsw
execve does not
posix spawn explicitly creates a new process
libsyringe
by jumping into kernel code that calls into ppl code
(although even if it is protected by ppl a kernel pac bypass is sufficient to modify it)
idk if the proc struct is protected by ppl
hook dyld and call libkernrw every time a process is spawned (?)
while execve is just replace
posix spawn explicitly requires creating a new process
so it is just more patches on that part
well libiosexec already patches execve
and also in libiosexec run some code before jumping to the entry point of the program to fix some euid stuff
to auto set posix spawn persona
patch execve in libiosexec
hack at it
you need to patch sudo openssh dropbear ping ping6 at least
id say patching command line tools would be even more interesting here
which i personally have done in a certain project
first one is just replacing path and second one is just about setting some posix spawn persona
you need to patch cydia itself to make it work
and i mean sha2 and rsa
even with no exploit
the crypto the devices  use today will probably be cracked
just wait 200 years
and every non-per-user-data in that prefix is deployed by apt
make sure everything is installed in a prefix
or rather
it is mostly being used incorrectly
every system is flawed
or just outright temporarily dead repos that makes apt hang for 30 seconds before continuing
that happens _a lot_
if one repo takes 10 seconds to respond then every repo after that gotta wait
so it becomes a lot very quickly
apt updates repos sequentially
noone uses more than 7 repos on linux
owofetch
playlist
i have a 139 hrs 7 mins
apparently the person that makes linux-apple
having it to run on a touchbar would be nice also
i mean bare metal
no not vm
need to bake up a dts
there is a kernel fork for that soc
worsediscord.app
how did you get it to not bootloop
zebra macos
omg my eyes hurt
checkra1n overlay mandates tvloader.dmg besides loader.dmg
slight issue though
odysseyra1n loader.app
and with new checkra1n just make an overlay with
it doesn't even work with scp 9.0
that one is dead anyways
aka allow untested
more fragile against new kernels
it is just
most of time it is replacing stuff with nops and jmps instead
not really instability
to make it work
and for substrate they will probably patch the kernel more even heavily
cydia isn't an issue on bind mounts
most system tweaks are utterly broken rootless or not
practically things that work are
it is
it did
ios 14 didn't break pongoos
eh not really
(1) nothing (2) it is checkra1n so. they can just patch that
hopefully pongoos works though
ios 15 is xnu 7938 to 8020
apple uses bindfs
don't worry new version of checkra1n probably won't support xnu 8792
get sram pongo to work on ios 12
they are doing regression fixes
technically checkra1n
slim gets pinged 1000 times a day
and no i don't have it
you need to ask someone for one
same type of device
it must be
unless someone can send the right rootfs dump
it bootloops tethered or not
they are on 14.8.0.5
use that dtbpack
because it isn't on the cdn
use that dtbpack
unless it is a dtb thing
send screen
then use pongoterm
boot with load_linux
now boot
preferably with smp too
why not
and if t2 could work that would include ps_2005
that means pinging hydrate haxi0 nathan and galaxy
eh i will send a new pr to on1x if i can get kernel to work on every major revision
or they have a7-a8, a11
no one complained yet that means no one on windows uses it
that is shipped in on1x 2.15
that's also the kernel
in #linux
it is probably floating as some attachment
it is a regression
a9 worked before a11
it has
on a11
showed signs of life
that is literally the first kernel that
it has multiple issues
kernel panic
that one serror on usb
or a9
this is the kernel that also doesn't work on a9x
now get it to boot on a11
deleted
on a11
this should boot to userspace
not problematic kernel
so you need a problematic pongo
because it worked before
or unfix it
after rewrite
apparently some aic stuff broken
as linux a7
runs at about the same speed
linux a11
i think
and remember only one core is up
efficiency cores
linux on a11
it boots on little cores
guess why
runs slower than linux on a10
linux on a11
aka bootloop mode
ssh in normal mode
they are all in dyld shared cache
can you ssh normal mode btw
grab the procursus ldid
it is checkra1n anyways\
just resign it with ldid then
makes every binary trustcached
i think  checkra1n
does it  not work with checkra1n
there's also the issue of dyld shared cache
it wouldn't work because some platform binary stuff
go ahead coretrust bypass every 14.8 binary
it would be a very cursed setup
and el0 is user mode
because xnu runs in el2 on that
drop linux into el1
find a pac+ppl bypass
linux on t8112 easier
but linux
rom is a flat arm64 executable
internalui has bsd tar
but bsd tar does not have one file system
pretty much
what else
tar up the filesystem
nowhere
does succession works on 14.8.1
grammar
nothing explodes besides sep
and no you need to somehow restore a 13.7 sep
trustcache
so you replaced
it is useful for a extreme edge case
are not completely useless
14.8.1 blobs
we know that
so at least
14.8 rootfs
14.8.1 kernel
cursed setup
where it tries to verify dyld shared cache
it probably gets up until the point
bootloop?
untethered
what happens
iphone 8
ok gn
that was on 5.19-rc1
we are on 5.19
on the old kernel
iphone 7 (intel)
did samsung make a8
apple soc uses samsung uart
we need it to print at least a line on serial
well it hangs
it still crashes
it will be out for sure on or before 2026
last time i checked 15.6 ramdisk works for 15.3.1 kernels
and absolutely everything else is 14.8.1
14.8.1 with 14.8 rootfs and ramdisk
they are only useful for tether downgrading to 14.8 and having checkra1n work
man has a 14.8.1 blob
14.8.1 blob
to approductionmode false
when the device is demoted
you can get 15.6 blobs
all of them have linux abi support
and (!) dragonfly bsd, openbsd, netbsd and freebsd
and less storage
with qemu user mode
that would allow it to work on any arch
apple music
for android
apple made
that linux anisette library
user mode emulate
why not
windows 7
any hints?
how does it do anisette
i saw redacted repo icons
obviously
rip it from the ota
and dyld shared cache
most likely result of trying to boot untethered is bootloop
14.8.1 kernel gotta be compatible with 14.8 if you patch it
14.8 ramdisk
he has a 14.8.1 blob
to make checkra1n work
tether downgrade to 14.8
remember to replace the trustcache
literally everything is from 14.8.1 except the ramdisk and root dmg
mixing 14.8 and 14.8.1
did you do the 14.8.0.5 thing yet
pac+ppl bypass and drop a payload into el1
send this image to. #linux
paink????
it happens a lot on a9x too
to reduce user error
only use your own initrd
dtbpack
pongoos
just use the ci kernel
but sure
use load_linux
u can just
still funny that it is a samsung uart
so you are good
both samsung uart and earlycon is enabled
because konard moment
go ahead pass earlycon=s5l,0x20a0c0000 to cmdline
since you have serial
which device
blobs are ecid and approductionmode specific
that screen
you show that pongoos crashed
which device did you test
maybe earlycon
signs of life means linux verbose boot
it would be super obvious if it is somehow my issue though for initrd
i used everything except initrd from ci and absolutely no signs of life on a9x
the threadtime is so obviously broken
for a9x and below
or figure out how to do a sha1 second preimage attack
quickly
is to figure out how to factorize really big numbers
all you need to liberate all devices
but you can flip it temporarily by demoting the device
always 1
though approductionmode is practically
blobs are ecid + approductionmode specific
and rewriting some aic stuff
rebased on top of 5.19 (was previously 5.19-rc1)
linux
then what is it for
well this is bad
so fake
they do
you need make -j$(nproc)
altlinux works on aarch64?
reflection
password is password
import it
gl sending partial usb packet on windows without a custom driver
gaster works on windows???
even if you get the usb to work
wsl doesn't work for tethered
download and click on it in finder
now import this file into the mac keychain
you need filza deb
note: wsl is fine for this
a lot of people don't help here
yes or rename to replace
xxx-xxxxx-xxx moment
because
for every ios
the filename is diffrent
the trustcache needs to match the blob
and maybe xxx-xxxxx-xxx.dmg.root_hash
they need to be valid as they are handled by iboot
with 14.8.1 ones
also replace the 14.8 trustcaches
i think
like xxx-xxxxx-xxx.dmg.trustcache
but is in 14.8
there are stuff that isn't in 14.8.1 folder
it isn't
not delete and move
replace
buildmanifest.plist determines what files are installed
no need to
stuff like ramdisk dmg trustcache
because
don't delete original files if not replaced
replace
kernelcache.release.iphone10b
but 14.8.1 patched exploits won't work
result is that stuff thinks you are on 14.8
everything else is 14.8.1
14.8 ramdisk and rootfs
i mean
right
quite literally only the root dmg is different
even the kernel
resign it with img4tool
can you make that one valid as well
everything up to iboot is valid
without pc
does it get to recovery mode
i think 14.8 should work with 14.8.1 kernel?
so something is off in stage 2
also pongo is stage 3
since pongo runs after iboot had ran
maybe you need valid kernel trustcache as well
i think
i mean a properly signed one
i think it might work if you flash valid iboot and llb?
in the ota update
there's llb
i think
don't forget that a11 ipis are also broken
from that
it is a long way
linux upstream requested some changes
the aic code will get reworked anyways
so "somehow"
t2 apple tv 4k and homepods aren't supported either
don't forget a9(x) is somehow broken again
and obviously it didn't happen
smp is supposed to be done by now accroding to previous messages
a9(x) boot regression
it worked on nathan's tv
i think that's fixed
symmetric multiprocessing support
t2 boot support
given that only the path changed
eh there really isn't much beyond these
and change the deb arch
someone managed to do it
actually it can work rootless
and personal info
waiting for someone to run checkra1n on vortex86 socs
zeebruh
that seems even more broken than before
it just won't work though
fruhhlower
where did i do that
im not sharing that
so many debug symbols
it is from the new ipa
nice username
doesn't the existing one work
that's the old binary
actually it isn't
checksum moment
there's probably malware on that site
the main binary doesn't match
it doesn't match
uh oh
ldid: -e, -q, and -h requre a signed binary
is this true
flowerbreak
and that core cluster can be in p mode or e mode
a10 has like two coes
need smp on a11
is maxmem respected
i mean ps_2005's t2
t2 boot fix
a9x boot fix
disable watchdog timer
ios -1
thats a boot arg
pass this to xcodebuild
code_signing_allowed=no
not every knows english
aight
no that's added in ios 5 i t hink
is reading hard
just not a good one
it is
they totally can add icloud lock to it though
the display
i think it doesn't have icloud lock?

force dfu motherboard pins
unless you want to boot with a pc every time
blobs are device and production mode specific
software rendering
not possible untethered without blobs
on a11 that point is apparently also routed over lightning but i have no idea how to do that
the only way on a10x or below is apply 3.3v voltage on a certain point of the motherboard
they need force dfu  because broken buttons
do it over ssh
not here
where
brb im making a m1 pro ssh ramdisk
arm64e???
does it work on arm64_32
then apply 3.3 v of voltage on the force reset pin
you need to apply 3.3 v of voltage on that
it is a metal point on the motherboard
force dfu pin
flower theme confirmed good
useful tip: chimera taurine and odyssey bundles pirated material
you can say so
it cannot be pirated
therefore
it  cannot be copyrighted
therefore
work of art
is not a
a certificate
not replacing everything with 0
this is real irecovery output
omg i need to stop building linux 5 times a day
does this happen to be very recent hardware
there are ipad specific tweaks
of course with some modification that makes it find files from inside containers
trust me
i  tried permasign pojavlauncher
and not kernel panic 200 times a second
and not be a kernel panic machine
final one would be more stable
which would still be useful because filzaescaped15 is super unstable
or filzaescaped15
to install
need ssh ramdisk
i need real flowers
what is that
not apple store genius
you are smart
u should understand it
ur a genius
but i can tell you that is a bad idea too
why not hook every file operation in libsystem
because springboard happens to have that entitlement
and yes springboard tweaks can still do it
and tar is not signed with that entitlement
bit of storage
an entitlement to use the last
because ios 14 requires
which wouldn't work properly on ios 14
fill up the storage
is to
the only way to bootloop like that
i think
on ios 14 they are just written to some folder on rootfs
they _can't_ bootloop you especially on ios 14
you shouldn't even mention themes
how would a bunch of png bootloop you
how would a theme bootloop you
i send creepy stuff into flower's dms
or use the ssh to bootstrap
don't bootstrap
rootless is just
bindfs
not for real
is coming along nicely
dragging bingner and siguza  into procursus
and bingner
wheres jake james
not 11 or 13 lol
12 maybe
it is bad
obviously
we need a jailbreak that is both latest and legacy
noooooo
nick chan break
flowerbreak
just scrap unc0ver
and stuff should work
change every mention of procursus and memo to whatever
pwn can fork procursus
as i said
why not go patch jailbreakd and kpf
why would it
the deb arch changed
would figure that one out quickly
although any orange name and green name
that's the most lazy way while refusing to use procursus on the surface
then call it pwn bootstrap
sed memo pwn
sed prcorsus pwn20wnd
fork procursus
and has been done
rootless cydia is 100% possible
release 1 second after fugu15 releases
what even is this nonsense
:frupper:
frmiddle
then unc0ver.dev will be filtered
c0ver.dev or something
unc0ver would also be filtered
profit
get it filtered
make a piracy repo called c0ver
omg fake jb
so naturally it would be rec0ver
because it undos what unc0ver does
restore rootfs (rec0ver)
that hasn't been updated
u just need to find a reviewer device
so is ipad 2 on 4.3
is longer
rootless cydia
rootless elucubratus
else it wouldn't be latest anymore
that is if they make an ios 15 version
the first jailbreak that to be both legacy and latest
u0 will soon be
still waiting for kmutil configure-boot for ios and ipados
skull issue
is a thing
su root -c 'dpkg --configure -a'
same issue
nyu is turkish
never mind
sha2 is a hash algorithm
you can use remote anisette
is a mystery
why did apple even allow this app
"recent"
it is guaranteed to happen eventually
actually
it will come out from there
decryption
i think it is doable with macos arm64e
how about macos
how about ~~s8010~~ for a16
m2 is t8112
so ppl bypass is ppl rw
i need to stop being lazy and read up some stuff
perfect
code can't be modified at all i think
you mean data?
im dumb
wait that needs pac bypass
can't you jump into x
it isn't a microkernel either
kernel data pages
some kernel stuff
plus i think it does
u think i did not read that
page protection layer but wat
i forgot
what does ppl do again
nvm i think i confused it with something else
where there is no pac
you are on a11 and below
unless
to get to setuid
you have to construct a rop chain
pac bypass method kind of sucks though
paid services are signed
because a lot of 64 bit app has random bits of 32 bit in it
note: the app must not have any 32 bit component at all
yes jus enable wine64 when building
it does if the app is 64 bit
i should make one
plaintext
they just forgot about that whole open source thing smh
same method that a normal setted-up device skips setup.app on boot
setup.app is in applications
just some custom ramdisk
why does ventoy has checkra1n
how did you manage to delete libreadline
as well as some jailbreak data
jailbreak apps will be done
restore rootfs
you messed up badly lol
please enable log window and try again
it may not be due to other jailbreaks
mount is not
attach is fine
and rebooted at around disk700
device because sluggish at disk500
i think i did try to mount 1020 disks at some point
just attached
they aren't mounted
ok that's fast all ejected
time to eject those 1000 disk devices
where libkrw will work
i think you are using checkra1n anyways
it isn't hard to compile
no just make a custom deb
install libkrw
it only supports libkrw
i don't see any issues with that
it doesn't hang
trying to attach the 1022nd device
it hangs
which ends up being disk1020
max i can do is 1021
i haven't been able to attach more than 1021 disk devices to ios
that's just a github moment
create the snapshot i guess
on a userspace reboot
remount it first
do you want to rename snapshot
average unc0ver moment
where is reveal troll
factory flashed
maybe
fugu14 strap = idownload + launchctl + libkrw + trustcache + launchdaemons
and to change that a reboot would be needed
and it can only execute a predefined set of binaries
flower
you can use procursus bootstrap with checkra1n
odyssey ipa download
ipa download is in fact broken
odyssey
vm swap and log
you also need to replace some of the coprocessor firmware files in the ipsw with those from the ios version of the blob you use with tether downgrade to get any of the things like audio to work
of the version you are trying to downgrade to and the version of the blob you use to downgrade
depending on whether the coprocessor firmware compatibility
on a9x
i think gaster can boot unsigned bootchain
did you patch signature checks
need to have a logic bug i guess
not c
wait this is python
make it do an out of bounds read
why does it work like this
not ephemeral
if i bypass hsbc hk mobile banking i can get developer right
and what is a nyo
n word
is that
i want my besties to not be sleep deprived
u should get some sleep
there are parts of itunes and icloud in it
blue shield
they are most likely to work
especially tweaks for 3rd party apps
not necessarily though
taurine is semi untethered
this is for people waiting on ios 15
not every 14.4-14.8 version is supported either
you really need to do that to do stuff with root
how about patching selinux policies
it says xnu
please fix the kernel version string
or nokia n900
get sony xperia v lt25i
f lower
decompile patchd
does it support my android
is this photoshop
there is a ecid whitelist
cpfm 03 research fuse
research fuse
is it app or vip
i forgot which domain that is
so fake
unreal
mac_mount patches
union mount patches
it could
while still carrying some meaning
it is supposeed to be half nonsense
put it into google translate and you will know why i said this
as in that it mentions several piracy crap
so many piracy!!!
no step before booting should take more than 10 seconds
try again i guess
it has a higher chance of working
you can press control and c at the same time. to cancel cli mode
like right now
and you are using cli mode
are you using checkn1x
normal doesn't allow jailbreaking from dfu mode
cli mode is faster for this
just retry 2000 times
or amd mobile (laptop) devices
then retry 2000 times or use a intel pc
amd cpu
it needs to be in dfu mode
there is no device. that works with both fugu14 and checkra1n
fugu14 xor checkra1n
then will need to use fugu14 to restore rootffs
so if they messed up dpkg
u0 calls dpkg to restore rootfs
before it goes to booting...
at most a few seconds
until you delete it and reboot i guess
it isn't useless
it could be
and is still tethered to apple's servers
because it require user interaction
it isn't
what is a wicked
what does that mean
what is a yw
the real flappy bird is 32 bit
whats with this ramdisk
in itunes to select the ipsw
then shift click on restore
then you download the ios 15.6 ipsw
i think so
you can also use idevicerestore to restore ios 16
using itunes
but yes you can restore ios 15.6
no itunes version can handle ios 16 ipsws
you need an nonexistent version of itunes
are you restoring ios 16 ipsw
monterey on 2008 mac
nowhere
linux on a12
then let kpp check the unmodified pages
copy the entire kernel to elsewhere in memory, do whatever you want with it, patch the original pages to redirect execution there then unpatch it
ktrr fixed that though
ios for hdmi adapter confirmed???
even though kloader64 would work on ios 7 and 8
and sep that too
because kpp and ktrr
does haywire diags even exist
haywire?
how 2 run doom on haywire?
nathan have a shell on a hdmi adapter
siguza has all of them
check nvram
using ssh
in ios
can you set auto boot to true now
u used ssh ramdisk
6 gb storage
wait is it an ipad 5
did it  boot back into nonui now
sw_vers says iphone os 6
look at the pids
is this running on ios
internalui runs springboard
actual ios ui
but it has most of the libraries frameworks and stuff
nonui is ios without the actual ui
internal ui is basically just ios
make flowerbreak first
so you revive it
but you like saily
when will saily be alive
probably possible to tethered downgrade with a filesystem dump though
4.2.5 is only on news media review devices
it is
15.4.1 takes long time to jb
does know how to use a terminal
apt-get update
cydia works for multiple components
cydia good on iphone os 2
alias genius=
it is part of the soc
fdr compatibility
savage firmware
yonkers firmware
u1 chip
that barrier moved to 15.5b5+
and using a fresh blob
nonce freeze moment ig?
member edition
putting patched binaries back onto the ramdisk
there is one step that can only be done on macos or another jailbroken device
manual method
need pc to boot at all
every time
need to boot with pc
~~just tether downgrade~~
your device in non-demoted state
every device is different
~~unless tethered downgrade~~

how do i block updates on usb c to magsafe cable 2m
it is a certificate error
it is
that one is just xcodebuild error without error messages
even with code_signing_allowed=no
codesigning issues
last time i tried to compile delta on github action it is some
this is so funny
just dl it
no need
sileo hourly
how about replacing tips.app
ill probably just fork it
i need to figure out how to compile delta
sileo actions still refuse to use matrix
proves how inconsistent these people are
safest way to do it is use some no name account to do it
sounds like abuse
what kind of block
giant hack
and upload to a custom repo
use scheduled github action to pull and build
facts
how u explain this image then
and iphoneos-arm64
apparently it works
pretty standard modifications to me
mount an empty tmpfs over it
found it when i did python3 gui
and tk
there is man n
ok, uirotate it is then
where is uitokenlogger
it doesn't seem like it though
that's the issue
does it have a token logger
serena code
then li-ion
lipo has worse density
they aren't lol
this is self bot
there is no lockdownd though
u think it is possible to make ssh ramdisk on haywire?
it has to be really small though
u think regular ramdisks will work?
execute the extracted bins
then delete itself to save some memory
when run
that extracts itself
i think it is just a macho
i think you have around 48 mb of space to mess around with
it isnt real if it can't run doom
and doom
how are you planning to get a shell
right
maybe library validation?
i think it is due to something else
no lol
technically bsds can work
194 is too old
there are some libusb drivers crap
and good luck figuring out how to compile it
yeah there is no beta binary for that
for that operating system
that just means that there are no binary
it does
no proof though
15.4.1 is fine
skull
what are they going to do with it? delete the apple id?
probably require some private key
wouldn't the response be signed
so revokes can be bypassed entirely?
i hope apple isn't stupid enough to do that
imagine replacing the app store version of your own app and get your account banned
redacted database
they should
huh ok
which certs has ppqcheck
not mangling it and your apple developer account may be suspended
so com.google.ios.youtube.aaaaaaaaa
i would recommend mangling the bundle id
so it doesn't matter
it isn't in this server
and he's fine
just keep the crap outta here
no one really cares about what happens outside this server
where
it can
nathan 2 i mean
nathan
calendar app based
it would be like u0+fugu14
it won't
fugu14
not if the untether is too slow
what supported gui package manager works with multiple components then
would need extra check in dpkg
because it is unauthorised distribution
i mean kernel data abort
i figured out how to crash ios 15.5
huh interesting
what is an am
actually that might work now, idk
skull emoji
cryptex1 tickets
filza file manager 64-bit
do it when it is actually jailbreakable
filza file manager 64 bit
you only have to when you want to use the phone at all
you have to
how do i resist the urge of pirating ida pro
really
it is not like they are doing it now
eh it is fine
checkra1n is ez to use
there was a bug where it will falsely show up on that beta
ios 12b11 moment
they are theoretically a bit better but beta popup
15.6 betas
facts
also, you must use cli mode
and it must be launched as the root user
you just use the linux arm64 build of checkra1n
theos server
where
yeah ig
and a9x users can only use gaster
both works
it does
id rather donate them to cs
like fr it could drop at any time now or never
all the ads
they are probably doing it for $$$
status: could not be determined
gaster
ipwndfu
there is no rootless installer
and yes rootless cydia exists
also you would only be able to use sileo cydia and zebra for guis
like what is wrong with fork()
like fr i got more info just from kirb
ah yes basically stating existing public info again
they are basically whitename questions
the ios 15 q and a barely reveals anything detailed
please no
that doesn't need jailbreak
you can use taurine
u can revert without updating
watch them unsign those
where is savage
firmware for the camera coprocessor
how does it not work then
camera firmware didnt work??
what if tihmstar beats checkra1n to do it
that depends on firmware compatibility
someone needs to update the tag
average irecovery moment
the only thing that can't work on linux is ramdisk repack
pretty sure linux can be used to restore the device and do *most* of the patching
and i can use linux to boot the device afterwards
skip blob
and i use fr to restore the ipsw
then how did you fix it
asr patcher
restored_external patcher
or just do manual crap
then what tool do you use
sunst0rm?
what do i do with the ipsw then
in the coprocessor firmware
huh so ig there are signing
it works enough for the device to boot
it does
the key store
device wouldn't boot without sep
the phone needs sep to boot
also sep is still partially working lol
i mean whether to replace sep firmware
how about sep
where to i place the firmwares
\\\\\\
mess with coprocessor firmwares?
plus would need pc to boot every time
plus doesn't work on arm64e
dfu restore will work for that
checkra1n better
it couldn't hold any charge for more than 36 hours
that device has a very bad battery
no imei for you
trolla
i use adb wireless to screenshot that device
armv7 device chilling on android 10
it does
cpu is snapdragon s4
android 10
i managed to get a screenshot off that device
should i take a screenshot
it is a personal computer
there
and yes it is the best state
not a separate flower
flower#1116 is just one of the states
i have classic flower pfp
frlower is the third state
am i your oomfie
these 2 flowers are just 2 of the 3 possible states the actual flower can be in
just join other servers you enabled dms
the changes
i think it is just a few sed commands
it never handled stuff very well on new ios versions
probably about same as before
you can see it is obviously rootless
installed files
that means cydia will continue to drag along
this looks right to me actually
and iphoneos-arm64 arch which is taken care of as well
the things that are changed are the paths
apt and stuff is still there
what else are you expecting
why are they considered a troll again
the modifications does make sense
rootless cydia
now every jailbroken device needs to only operate inside a faraday cage
dns blocking
a10 moment
although i think that tool is broken as for now
just don't reboot
210 days uptimes aren't hard
it isn't that bad i think
or at least never tried to
idk how to
it wouldn't work anyways
15.1.1 is released in november
i think
90 days for 15.1 is long past
sounds sensible to me
on 15.1
ios 15.1 now available
rare natalie sighting
what about it
i think that will bootloop
then it would need to be added in when patching iboot
and this combination has baseband issues
just because ios 14.3 sep is compatible with 13.7
the root device boot argument
and on linux you would need to use an iboot patcher like kairos to patch in boot args here
because sep
dualboot ios 14 on ios 13 device
and you would patch in rd= boot args to dualboot
for dualboot
need compatible sep anyways
no that needs pc
you would install the os with divise first
divise i guess
i think it is this one
not just non-free
even the official ones
awww it seems all the debian weekly-live-builds links are dead
i need to find
debian has like 10000 isos
and ntfs-3g and ntfs3 uses ntfs features intended for that
it has to able to because of the deprecated windows nt posix subsystem
it can
this is what gparted do
you can if you copy the entire filesystem to the left then expand it to the right
target system uefi partition scheme gpt
both ntfs3 and ntfs-3g can do ntfs permissions
it certainly can
how about udf
it can
ntfs can do permissions
it just forces read only if you mount without nobrowse
ntfs.fs has write
it does
it is done
it does
default
can confirm if you are never going to store file bigger than 4 gb
diskmgmt.msc
even for normal storage
uefi only better
dd mode
sounds right
not understand in what way
but it is distributed across 3 days
eh the actual amount of time spent is more like 10 hours
all done jailbroken on 14.7.1
we went though a 72 hours session
is one that runs windows xp
and the only laptop he have
when ios 14 is signed
this man wants to downgrade from ios 15
right
average pentium m laptop
that system has 256 mb of ddr2 ram
it needs lowmem=2 for the installer to even run correctly
using the lowmem=2 installer
new to linux
i guided someone to install debian
i guess
you used proot
experimental is actually unstable from normal user perspective
this is testing not unstable
unlearn windows is harder
how do you think about linux lite
because filzaescaped itself is quite broken
it does if it works at all
i have postmarketos on a certain machine
not an issue from the perspective of something like debian
firmware
and stuff
although i did end up adding non free for intel microcode
all the hardware
my pc runs fine with debian main
dvd 1 should work should any internet issues pop up
dvd-1
is finding the right iso
most difficult thing about installing debian
most instructions are for debian based so i would say debian
or just use the debian live installer
debian install is fine now
alpine linux
debian non free testing exists
how about debian
well both chmod and chflags it seems
how does unc0ver disable ota
that particular device seems to be a checkm8 device
how about using a ssh ramdisk
just reset all contents and settings
ooc screenshot
that's assuming it will be released at all
what is a ong
man got  member plus from these messages
galaxy fold
skull
omg 0.29 tps
unless buy another device
no jb yet
and daemons
and ability to insert custom trustcache
tweak injection is hard yes
u just need to make a giant trustcache
working sileo isn't too hard
it isn't for u0 6.0.0
especially since that is not going to work on arm64e
i suppose that wouldn't be a ssh ramdisk
just buy another device on lower version
it is
15.5b4 is better
wholesome
there's an edge edge edge case i can think of
15.5b4 better
it says 0.32 tps
cydiasubstrate.framework
jailed tweaked app
in that they have so many regressions
they are bad for ux
the ad makes the ui skull emoji
id agree if it wasn't for the ad
u don't get bashed at on this discord if you use chimera
not on 12.4
figuring out which u0 version to install is not exactly user friendly
how about the regression thing
and doesn't have regressions for old versions
chimera has a more update to date bootstrap
saily the best - flower
why not ios
a15 skull emoji though
because from eating time the tps seems to be lower than what is being shown
i think the tps counter itself is lagging
what kind of dish
and boba did not have any issues with it
then it is repurposed for hopper minecarts
it was for tnt minecarts
boba-approved leg machine
hopper minecarts
there are 27k
two seconds per tick wtf
make them apple processes
just patch that out for every process in jailbreakd
right
and app store stuff is signed by apple
isn't ct bypass cert app store fast path
lots of testing
cs. forgot one step at last
what happened with fork on ios 15
jank++++
this is jank
did linux work on your a9
normal dfu
you do if you use checkra1n
really
no command. sense needed
iphoneos-arm wouldn't install anyways
i think info.plist at least
some of the stuff is probably needed
gm flower
for ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma jailbreak
been waiting for 4213 days
or just uicache in preboot
like tips.app
it would be like taurine-permanent
not true
dragging windows around = 50% cpu usage
im using software rendering
software rendering kind of sucks
fixing fixes
although libiosexec is much more than libiosexec now
so what kind of fix
didn't cameron did it
what kind of fix
now it needs close to no work
it needed some work after macos procursus
it needed a lot of work before macos procursus
that build certainly worked on a11
may be build incorrectly idk
hop into #linux again ig
it is outdated so
often it works with 1 - 2 tries
where is otadisablerdisabler
call dpkg to restore rootfs
actually yes
i can't imagine it being too different from a10
t2 didn't work probably because of my bad device tree
exclude bootstrap repos
i wouldn't recommend using iamlazy
let me grab some for you
id say
apt-ftparchive
they are repos
can't tell without `earlycon=s5l,0x20a0c0000` on kernel command line
didn't boot for whatever reason
i can only say
ding ding ding
it would just not do anything after `booting linux`
wrong kernel wouldn't cause that
edit 5 tries because it failed 4 times
that's the max that happened me
i hope not more than 5 tries
note: nebula is still wholesome
not wholesome dev role
nwholesome
it will eventually work
i say keep trying
please. tell me you didn't ask for dev
but usually you won't be that unlucky
it has happened 4 times in a row for me once
dumb bug that happens time to time
just try again
and i can have permasigner in c
if nebula can have dev role i should too
it is frgay though
and linux-apple does not support 64k
there's only 4k 16k and 64k
debugging android with an ipad
8k doesn't exist
it is 16k
there
i still need to find that cursed image
im not touching that it until some new hardware works
too useless
but i fixed that so
i think the biggest build issue i have with adb is that it would build with arm64-apple-ios 10.14.0 for ios 12
firebloom
iboot emojis
why no firebloom logo smh
does it reboot
can you get any pongo serial output
but then dead
it does get executed
so im not in the mood of opening prs right now
cuz the reason i closed the prs in the first place is it went too long without comments or merges
to be certain
i just tested it again
how about  i open android-tools pr now
i know the one that prs adb and fastboot works
can't have nick chan moment if i close all the prs
it is
it has a missing libbrotli1 depends at some point
libgnutls30
indeed procursus breaks more frequently than elucubratus
too complicated
too complicated
like trustcache
and no need to upload various other components
no need to wrap in macho
well it is easier
uploading pongo as ibec instead of kernel
so it suggest it did get loaded
device disconnects then reboots after like 6 seconds
pongo.bin wrapped in img4
as if it is a ibec
tried booting pongo from ibss
and all tvos 9 - 13 users should upgrade
tvos 14+
how would you do it on tvos 13
tvos untether can hypothetically goes up to 15.5b4
send them into apple stores
does recoveryos not work
unless untether
can probably be bypassed with some provides: hacks
well now it disappeared
slull
well it isn't hypothetical anymore
uicache
that worked for pojavlauncher i think
probably
protv can't happen without sileo or zebra working
if the website is down
and the package manager doesn't work at all
skull emoji
it wouldn't look good without sileo or zebra though
because nitotv is dead
crystal has to do that to make tvos pojavlauncher
provides
**really** need to fix the single point of failure that has failed
so we are doing that libapt-pkg6.0 rpath thing ig
how about messages before april 10 2020
to determine the context
make gir an actual ai
when eta context detection support
it is a slur only in certain contexts
which has additional privileges
which makes every binary a platform binary
which makes the kernel thinks that every binary is in the trustcache
that's a physics word describing negative acceleration last time i checked
lookup_in_trustcache patch
i told you
or a11
tsssaver does
it has to be normal ota though
try it
why not
only works if you have the exact file name
at least on ios 14
xnu union mounts are too broken for this
union mounts exists on 15.0b1
make it ra1n
what does nbd mean
does it work
u kind of made it worse
how would that fix the problem
reboot because sep is mean if you boot from dfu
exploit dfu, run payload, write exploit 2 and secondary payload to nand, reboot
would be best
dfu usb exploit coupled with img4 parsing exploit
axi0mx probably sitting on one right now
and it will work
u resign a zillion bins
i think it may as well exist in iphone os 2
does it use psychic paper
loading bro
no release though
probably
at least text colours are normal now
framebuffer still have issues
it is broken on homepod t2 and apple tv 4k
brctl_internal
another one is replacing launchd
one of them is literally same logic but another stock command
i already figured out two other ways of doing it
a lot of makefiles and a bit of c
i think it is more than 3000 in fact
and released
i surely have written more than 1000 lines of code for ios related stuff
beta alerts on non beta
an actual one
would i get dev role if i make nickchanbreak
how do i get dev role
man got dev from python script that just use other bins to do the job
not sure
and i think that worked up until like a13
need some bug in the img4 parsing code
it is
untethered too
how about m2
probably trustcache patch
why fr
everything is a platform binary on checkra1n
probably lookup_in_trustcache patch?
what name
wait does this require blobs again
yeah ig
u certainly release some stuff
what kind of stuff
why did you have dev role
preboot is a mount point
it is a mount point
lol no
on a8x
what is the checkra1n issue again
my a9x odysseyn1x iso exists
i did
detected corrupted kerninfo
skull emoji
a9x fix more important
3 words
instead of restore
not if you click update
ios 17 does not exist
around november 2019
on one of the display macs
checkra1n cli should be ok
u can run checkra1n using the display mac
do it at the apple store
u need code execution on the samsung tv
that could work
this question is equivalent to wen nickchanbreak
linksys routers should do for checkra1n
sideload using android phone
that depends on how to define computer
technically speaking
this has dragged for so long
tihmstar
checkra1n
jailbreakd exists for a reason
pretty sure it can be
what is this file
safemode.app
safemode app icon
ssh ramdisk
!t blockota
com.apple.appleseed.feedbackassistant
so u aren't theming xcode previews either
how about feedback assistant
the icon is visible from the app switcher
no icons for these too
diagnostics and print center
also ftminternal-4 icon
wow no icons for a stock app
xcode previews, vlc
need taurine permanent icon
i need more parousia icons
eh 1000 weeks is still coming weeks
which is confirmed by siguza
when checkra1n allows uploading custom overlay
checkra1n memo link isn't working anymore
checkra1n memo
which one
so no
there is no rickroll
please elaborate a bit
i need to make tweak and get orange name
from fat macho binary
i'm referring to removing architecture
i think you have no idea what you are talking about
can't see why it wouldn't work if the device is signed in with that apple id
why not
i mean like thinning the binary
iirc stripping slices is allowed
flower theme very good
need more icons in parsouia
paid developer account
sounds boring
hayden doesn't use tweaks
i have no idea
very fr
any trans i suppose
what kind of it
#5eadec #a98ed6 #e6e7e8
i need to come up with a ~~crappy~~ good theme and claim the designer role
what's with the hearts on the bio
on a custom bootstrap
and use that for development
so they end up forking procursus
but nitotv is dead
they want to make tvos pojavlauncher
it must be wholesome because it is flower
what theme
actually crystal is working on it
also what did you design
are you on your way being a developer
huh interesting
how about linus' method
ssh ramdisk
it should work on tvos 15
var cannot either
preboot can't have ssv
else dfu loop
if you don't rename the snapshot nothing happens
i included it
launchd is pid 1
device booted fine
rebooted
i replaced launchd
analyticsd
gamed
they are daemons
during the last few seconds of boot
backboardd is responsible for the apple logo
and the other developer of it get developer
yeah that is pojavlauncher indeed
it spawns java vms
another hint
hint it absolutely drags the battery, does jit and is not utm
i know someone who wrote like half of a jailbroken ios app and did not get developer
and fakelaunchd
i have filerproviderctl_internal
just use those sim unlock modded sim or something
i know south korea does crapton of 2g base stations on the dmz borders
2g is sometimes required to get broad signal coverage
because iphone does not support china 3g protocol (except lte)
so at the weaker signal regions that can totally happen
n+1g signals drops off more rapidly than ng
no they are defined by international telecommunication union
it is true
downgrade to iphone os 1
and is very fast 3g
just keep in mind that baseline lte is not 4g
lte+ does reach the requirement for 4g though
lte do not reach 4g speeds
lte is 3g
gprs too
i have edge network working in my region
bridgeos jb is even more useless
(although that's pretty much it for an average user's wants)
like custom voice assistant and music services
potential not tapped
not tapped
it is just
not really
idk about bridgeos
same applies to audioos
as it  does not have ssv
in theory tvos 15 can still be untethered
there's literally no reason anything new would use the fugu14 untether exploit though
sileo doesn't need tweak injection
looks like flowerbreak ripoff
more like 2
wait 5 years
eh just re it instead
in a community centered around reverse enginnering u can't effectively protect anything
ssh ramdisk
by using a captive wifi
and u can reach webkit from setup
well this implementation is a rejailbreak so not exactly
come on
there are 64 bit support for 9.2 - 9.3.3
there is for 9.2 - 9.3.3
can work here
webkit jb
can someone check whether 2020 has ended
we are at that again
not really
screenshot without context be like:
maybe it is possible to dual boot with different sep if the version to dualboot to is signed when it is installed?
i bootloop from testing custom stuff
semi-tethered downgrade
dual boot is
bootloop has always been a thing
nah ive bootlooped ios 14 devices
same could be said for safari
12 hours apart
u can see why i don't want to deal with these people
let's just say taurine and odyssey ripoff dev
im done with that wannabe jb dev
i guess no
should i reply to redacted on twitter
i need advice
but it isn't for somer reason
which *should* be fine
is like 1.5 years old
actually the entire device
the battery in this device is like ,uhh
i would agree
why does the iboot command prompt banner has emojis in it
coretrust bug can probably untether tvos 15.5b4 (?)
sounds like appstore++ moment
u should stay on ios 14 if u want an actual untether
all japanese
wholesome
replacing dyld didn't work
with that cert
it has to be signed
not some how jb 16
your skill set
yeah that's fine
rjb discord would be much nicer if anything have your skill set
are you using ldid to sign stuff for 15
newterm ipa coming up
so not the entire app
how about assets.car
which files to replace
i mean like
no luck with macos newterm
i can grab you binpack and fixed newterm later if you like it
gamed is another thing that is useless
resign procursus binpack
why would u0 remount it
mount preboot
anyways can just remount
and resign a crapton of command line binaries and libraries
newterm work u just need to modify the login path
ios 15
launchd replacement is kind of hard to debug
if you want to have some daemon to replace
id recommend analyticsd
me be like: just touch launchd instead
and yes it is from testing
that will bootloop
i went ahead and replaced launchd, yes
testing it is
replacing launchd does
it can
that would make it like another 2 seconds earlier
possible because coretrust bypass
nor bootlogo when
hayden detected!!
no one uses swf nowadays
swf is too
svg neither
bmp is not compressed
that has the function
you need to compile also the file
that's so obvious
come on
especially since it needs to decode video and audio
but it probably has one?
not sure about gpu
either no nor flash. or unformatted
no nand
256 mb ram
it's has an a6-like chip
bus 001 device 036: id 05ac:8600 apple, inc. apple t2 controller
i forgot
what is the pid code of apple inc., apple t2 controller
u need to make it run doom

ibss wouldn't accept stuff
pwn lightning digital hdmi adapter
although i think the apple pencil thing just map the pins as is
that's a bit more complicated
female lightning to male usb a adapter
haywire
to not boot
hack different may have better ideas?
does ireceovery -f does nothing
attached to it
it would if it has a valid apticket
there are no ecid constriants
sounds sensible
img3tool
that's nonsense alphabets
enter reset enter
u need to reset the terminal
please don't use blue shield
in the path
also why does it says blue shield
not malware
it isn't lol
lol no
well it mostly is correct
because it is
it is
without libraries
memory patching is needed if the app performs raw syscalls
may need memory patching
series 7
but it is a watchos ipsw
firmware update listing
how do i save usb to magsafe cable 2m blobs
assuming that it doesn't change the keyboard mode back right away
if you do that on a xorg session
u can type into xorg's tty
force it into a mode where it interacts with a virtual console
it basically makes your keyboard
r supposedly sets keyboard mode to system default
omg hand reveal
too many reflections
alt + sysrq + b
im dumb
check dmesg
overwrite it
please don't append
probably not
it doesn't work in a kernel panic btw
that particular key combo reboots the machine
and if that doesn't work just press `alt + sysrq + r`
just disconnect phone
don't
bootra1n has 0.11.0
unless a7
why 0.10.1

what is a ong

right
ya know that's hyper obvious in compat mode
freemoji user
u mean firmware setup
webhook can edit messages now i think
how about using a webhook
no tvos 16 profiles yet
!t blockota
about chainloading firmware
i believe with a pac+ppl bypass it would be possible to run some shellcode in el1 on a14...
i am talking about kloader
or all 32 bit devices
for 64 bit
but they only worked up til ios 8
it... does
too many protections

i ping cameren a lot for questionable reasons
there's also the issue of leap seconds

and attempt to edit it
itunes backup
please tell me
what is s temple of satan
uploading a .tar.gz renamed to .png
you can't make them anymore
i love tar.gz stickers
it has always been like this
i think
it says oops
how to load this
please post them to hack different if you can get them
and i would like keys too
ipwndfu
it is
there are 48 mb of memory for the ramdisk
it is
haywire firmware is just darwin
tvos watchos bridgeos audioos darwinos are all ios lites
not even launchd
the only thing they share are xnu dyld and libsystem
eh not really
ios is macos lite
clothos firmware updates
clothos 12.0
ios 12 seems quite different from 11
firmware update
no because most of them don't run xnu
should be counted
anything that runs bare metal xnu that isn't a hackintosh
haywire included?
i can verify
im smarter than a genius
make me genius
am i one
wat is that
slim kittens
genius can kick people out of vc
it would be fun
please no
like 2.5 hours i think
how far are we from 19 digit id
can confirm
but otherwise it works ok i think
fugu14 is no
if you can boot the os at all
may have implications for downgrading apple tv 4k
recoveryos
apple tv 4k has it
recoveryos updates
need flower's review to make sure it doesn't go overboard
after having flower to review it
then i can release it
ill collect more stuff until it reaches 7 mb
i have a slightly bigger flower zip
because it has to do decoding
i suppose yes
does haywire have a gpu
u can try
to plug it into macos
can you use an adapter
when run linux on it
lightning to usb a adapter
use a breakout board
some ios 12 beta iboots patched it
yeah checkm8 was originally found in iboot
i believe it is vulnerable
can you checkm8 the ibss
is it pwned
it has no nor flash, or is not formatted
unlike others
you *can* share blobs for haywire
comes with a global blob
all haywire firmware bundle
an adapter that runs xnu
b137ap or b165ap
using a breakout
connect it to pc
the apticket
u need to sign the img3 with
patched ibss?
still small
1.6 mb zip
patched xnu better
boot xnu from there
it has a ibss
there is no ibec
and run doom on it
can u spawn a shell
nice ecid
please review
set date back
flowerbreak
with wholesome stuff
yeah i could make one
i assume it doesn't exist
or i can make one
pwn20wnd.zip
pwn20wnd#8203
the release file is a list of hashes for index files on the repo
yeah so i can verify their release files
i don't even use adobe stuff
i just have a piracy repo's keyring
i didn't
and yes i have a piracy gpg keyring too
i know some that isn't there
add more piracy repos that i can find ig
ive seen piracy on gir
please no
assuming the tweak is packaged sanely
add repo that has dependency, try to install the main thing again
i mean the main thing
(apple music)
how about android
arm converter u mean
just completely static executables
ive seen altstore beta ipa
that sounds like it booted
kasan
i have every non version specific link to altstore stuff
altserver beta uses that link
it is

happy birthday+++++
press home to open
they should do ios security like macos security
wait less amount of time
yeah go to 15.5b4
155 years
i have very few tweaks
until 19 digits happens
soon it will be 99999 and 999999
message id now all starts with 9999
operation not permitted
and have their own server room
what if they selfhost
remote control
i can control every computer in the computer room
but that need jailbreak
actually divise can do semi-tethered downgrades i think
when semi-tethered downgrades
sorry i mean a nonce setter
how do you protect yourself from discord malware then
or else you risk damage via condensation

minecraft lets play running on episode #833
theres also flob
season 9
tnt slab
it does
like half an hour ago
and i *did* get on the server
im in a bad mood
sjeng
nathans-imac
nice one
any more and it couldn't do it
it can barely decode 720p 30 fps webm real time
1-1.5 hours of usage
the battery can only sustain about
standby
i mean like
or the battery would be flat
it must be charged at least every 36 hours
sony xperia v lt25i
minecraft 1.7.10
i managed to get 5 fps
u just need to hack it up
it can work on a7 1gb
it is
i hope this is ok
assuming that person is dumb enough to not remove sim card
it is a race between whoever that has it and how soon it gets internet
then when it reboots
it would panic trying to set a passcode
to remove this "drm"
i think it is just about deleting this entire if block
it certainly breaks eula, yes
due to demo mode
because mojang physically can't put that in
the normal downloads needs no authentication
it is
because demo mode
and it is open to anyone to download
it isn't when you download it straight from mojang servers
for pojavlauncher
do it then
skip library validation on everything
that makes some sense ig
i will do some ldid manpages updates
sounds like something that should be done by .app postinsts
aka no limit
it changes the maximum connections from 16 to -1
to remove dumb decisions
we already have a patch like that for aria2c
so bruh
it is an outright block too
that is actually. stupid
the stupid check
especially
you would need to patch out some checks
how would pojavlauncher.mk work then
anyways - just saying there are real demand for jdk 8
even have aarch64
actually idk whether jdk 7
that's the oldest thing that still has interests
how about 7
but so many mods absolutely needs java 8 for minecraft versions that runs on java 8
not that i agree with those braindead mods
braindead mods
not for 1.12.2
jdk 8
well for linux it would be so files
on windows and linux
from other actions
u have to rip dlls
the windows builds aren't static
limd artifacts are braindead
because android
and nothing else
for linux builds
u can only really assume kernel 3.0
u need to see a doctor (real)
cameren is very cool
bash on ubuntu on windows
looks like it stopped for now at least
yaya4
hey there
i think he's using shift
wall powered usb-a cable
then jailbreak using checkra1n using usb-c
i told some person to use a powered usb a cable to enter dfu
from dfu
that booting update ramdisk is not an option
also are there any reason for
dfu wouldn't exit automatically
dfu should work
just use lowercase-messages
huh interesting
it is intentionally formatted like that
hey detour, please consider chilling.
let's chill
it is just unsupported protocol
it doesn't
so when your 4g is dead you go to 2g
china 3g is unsupported by iphone
unsupported protocol
2g, 4g, 5g
china 3g be like:
in the springboard binary
hardcoded date
ios 4.2.5 is 4209 days
a shitty ssd would be slower than a modern high end hdd
i have nvme too
2^-335544320 chance of giving out a given 40 mb  data
if the jb is 40 mb in size
more like 2^-335544320
just unimaginably small
so technically it has a chance of giving an ios 15 jb
and an ios 15 jb is also just a sequence of bits
so just keep catting it
there is a non zero chance for it to give you an ios 15 jb
without jb
the only way is set date back
sus pended
gross
so that pretty much proves that it exists already
u need baseband exploit to do illegal stuff with it
skill issue
imagine press with 5 fingers to jailbreak
multi touch
then it is invalid
flower
interesting
not for the module repo
i think that'd for magiskhide
online module repo is dead
some android stuff
wheres cakeflower
noooo
no more flower 6999
really
flower 6999 keeps getting pinged
maybe 100 times?
i compiled linux kernel for idk how many times
go ahead find a buffer overrun in python
send u0 8 source code
not jailbreak related
no i mean like
what if flower is secretly a chimera
frupper
frmiddle
fruhhlower
frlower
finder
really
hi flower
is minecraft 1.19.84 out yet
minesweeper (10x10)
i use linux btw
can you say the arch word
in the springboard binary
it is a hardcoded string and time
hi drug mod!
manticore 2
realer than manticore
there are no ios 4.2.5 ipsw
yes if you attach it to a debugger
does ios 4.2.5 users still exists
a8-a9x exists
oh sure
how many days is it since ios 4.2.5 release
just make sure to stay in this server
replace springboard with fileproviderctl
on ios 14.8.1
should be possible
the date is too
hi clarity
are you fr
the last one is what all the permasigners uses
and to some extent the first one
we know how to abuse how to abuse the last one
and more on ios 16
there is a zillion mitigations on 15.4.1
and alternatesu
to tsssaver
to save blobs
i use a shortcut
so otas actually works
or opening the ota ui
how about reading the nonce again
stay on 14 if you ever want an untether
it is semi-untethered
it is semi untethered because it requires unlocking the device as well as user interaction
u0+fugu14 is semi-untethered
we have semi-untethered
then proceed
syscfg
only data and list of apps
man come back again
also that's rc
that's an ota update
why is htrowii gone again
ios 16 would be already out by then
already out
ios 12.0b12 fixes the issue mentioned above
there are 12 betas
when it is the newest beta
for everyone
where the beta alert is constantly triggering
i still remember ios 12 beta 11
set date back
u bootloop on ios 14 and recovery loop on ios 13 and below
basically your phone becomes an ibrick when it dies until you connect it to pc again
ibrick 7
tethered = won't boot at all without pc
could just patch out whatever checks there and have a jb if people are fine with tethered
keeping the semi part of semi-tethered is
making ios 15 checkm8 jb isn't that difficult
it doesn't have to
not really
that should scare a lot of people
just launch setup.app
sell your data
connection reset
that is equivalent
with 500 repos
apt sends requests sequentially
i mean like what apt is designed for
some users may have external repos
id say no more than 5-10
debian debian-backports debian-security
is the kernel patched
set date back
launchd listens on both port 22 on 2222
that is port 22
listener 1
persona error should be fine though
then it is port 22 for sure
ssh = 22 in launchd plists
there
how does the error look like
port 22
how about zebra 2.0
zebra 3.0
i think that doesn't work correctly anymore
i think the restored_external is needed to enable usb
add your own
so it is the only copy
on the ramdisk
launchd cache doesn't exist
right
maybe if you use a bin from redacted dumps it will work
iphoneos-arm64-binpack
do it against that source tree
can i just put the binpack in insert location here and expect it to work
nathan's ramdisk build works
that's for binpack
binpack moment
armv7 ios9 ramdisk
also if binpack is used for ramdisk ramdisk serves no purpose
binpack and ramdisk has different priorities
launchd cache doesn't exist on the ramdisk
it doesn't exist
can we have llvm-vtool
llvm-config
it sucks hell
but that's another question
if you can somehow get your code to run
u can
works up to 15.5b1
that is bad
don't compile with procursus clang
it is in build_dist then
that just means it didn't work correctly
not strap like stuff
debs go there
build_strap
springboard.ipa
set the date back
it is
install ncurses-bin
that's not a tvos issue
give darwin-arm64 zebra
provides: zebra:darwin-arm64
provides:
ramdisk from ipsw are img4
then archived again
an update is pushed
the repo was unarchived for a split second
and then maybe saily which is a sillyo ripoff
so people can use sileo zebra apt
cameron
and ramdisk is less of that
i didn't ran into too much issues when i tried to make tvos bootstrap i think
i think it is just a signing service no
fruhh
ramdisk stuff doesn't care about that
please pull upstream
ehh it probably would?
gm king
boobs
14.4b1 is not supported
not fully
ape = hominoidea
some apes certainly do
we are going to hit 19 digit ids in 2 days
maybe it is actually unsafe
not nebuwa though
nebula 2
plus ibus s4 exists
it is covered
it exists
diagnostic port
need an ibus cable
there are
not necessarily
tswaps stuff ig
save blobs
other jbs could come first
14.8.1 is much more likely to be jailbroken
use a pc
will there be an ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma jb
in terms of jb
because 15.5b4 is basically the same as 15.4.1
ios 16 fr breaks at sending nordata
itunes
that's true of any versions lol
also aaron doesn't have to be banned for that to happen
well quote unquote suggested ig
that's what i "suggested"
just make another alt
which still works
and the dabezt webhook
i have noncemanager deb
token logging
that sounds like persona.kb for me
persona.kb
just wait until aaron becomes lighter green
can confirm
samiiau approves of it
fullpwn is very alive
jtv 2
eh it is loosing money anyways
even for supported not everything is known to be tested
nick chan
and yes apple tv 4 works
all t2 apple tv 4k homepod
not never i suppose
we have patches being sent to lkml
linux-apple is less hacked up over all
both sandcastle and linux-apple can do that
odysseyn1x master has it
linux-apple
on the framebuffer
and iphone x has broken colours
i think i got  framebuffer working right away on a9x
sandcastle is 5.4
this is 5.19-rc1
here is a fixed one
iphone 8
well not everything
how fix
everything is bad on a9x
gaster has best ui
and the hack different ipwndfu can put it in pwned dfu mode but not to patch sig checks
only gaster can boot unsigned bootchains on it
how would sunst0rm work on a9x
using patchers limd stuff like that
id rather use the manual method
nice steve skin
use what
send minecraft username
ios 4.2.5 jb
not all jailbreakers
something ffmpeg needs needs needs needs them
something ffmpeg needs needs needs them
something ffmpeg needs needs them
what are you expecting
because it needs them
making them useless
another completely unrelated issue is we need to save cryptex1 tickets
there are libusb for windows
does libusb not work
where you can insert any driver you like
test mode
does it need the itunes driver
it is highly unlikely to be that
what do you mean
you can boot them for sure
on 15
they are useful for abusing ct bypass
not all of them
but they are on the rootfs
emojis
trolley
cough a7 cough linux
and yes i have a preference
i would just ping an nline admin that i like
flower
in fact altstore does it
stock
on 13.3 and below
to bypass free app limit
it is already possible
we don't talk about that here
taurine can't either
no lol
iphone 4 is armv7
that's armv7s
you should buy an iphone 5
that's 32 bit
for the most part
then it should just work
specifically i would like to try 15.0b2
ios 15 kernel
i mean like
(ios 14 ssh ramdisk can be booted on ios 15)
speaking for ssh ramdisk i haven't tried booting an ios 15 ssh ramdisk yet
that boots a ssh ramdisk
is when you are already bootlooped
the only case that you would want to get blob with ssh ramdisk
but it is super unlikely compared to even less likely
carries a higher chance of bootloop
if you are wary of that then you wouldn't want to be using a ssh ramdisk
waiting for a 15.1 jb is less work
by using the ssh ramdisk method
that sounds like gpu cracking
do they use nvidia gpus for that
use ish
enmity
i use the procursus ssh ramdisk
i used dualbootfun guide to boot a ramdisk
it is
u run that on the phone
and not even procursus cat has that
then you cat would need that entitlement
com.apple.private.security.disk-device-access
and you also need a dd with the right entitlements
u need macos to make the dmg
and disk1 is like 8 mb
16 mb in size iirc
so it is writable
in the first place
how did it get leaked
actually unencrypted is best
not an empty password
may as well not use a password
sichuan university
that doesn't work your phone dies at 30%
like with any other ios n tweaks
it is mostly because of ios n+1
the reasoning is wrong
i used _
i didn't
i didn't
how about discord emoji
i can confirm
that i still have and is functional
this is the worst smartphone
hi deandre!
there isn't a lot
itorrent
snapdragon s4
this one is armv7
charging it
the other one is an arm64 device
the other one ran out of battery
both of them are really crappy devices
as you can tell
functional androids that i have: lenovo tab 4 8, sony xperia v lt25i
goes beyond the edge of the screen
for sony xperia v
no android 12 roms yet
android posting
certainly not enough
`author: ` is an unknown field anyways
i have adb on ipad
i love 42612 ms ping
lmao i have enchantments on a banner
not green name
oh no
until it is changed
which is enough to make all ios 16 blobs useless
worried about cryptex1
not due to rootless
and with a jailbreak we can basically bend the userspace whatever way we want
just no persistence
and yes emojiport can be fixed
can be fixed
pretty much everything
(2) would include some stuff that has persistence
it is installing files to system paths
emojiport
update preferences loader and make the package manager move files
maybe they used corellium
after some patching
pretty much every app tweak (?)
just not by rootless
appsync will certainly be otherwise broken
appsync unified
and the current rootless method
scorpio
taurine is an amino acid
may actually understand that
i changed it to 0.8 because some people that voted yes
probably number of people that said go rootless times 0.8
so no
stock has always been rootless
the main thing is about the changes in stuff being hooked
probably nothing
rootlessjb3 patcher worked ok so
and have the package manager write files somewhere else
just update preferenceloader
and yes this is the case on orig-fs
so that should be fine
but not a lot
surely ik some stuff like emojiport actually writes to rootfs
and most breakage is just ios update moment
without actually modifying files
tweaks are about modifying stuff
because you would need to somehow hook dyld
but that sounds dumb too
or just hook every filesystem operation in userspace
unionfs.kext
but not that i think
bind mount is ok
on 16 gb devices
and let your rootfs be hardcore mode
plus tihmstar confirmed that modifying rootfs is fine
well whatever that is being mounted
it checks the snapshot
i mean dfu loop
you have to rename the snapshot to bootloop
still no
12.3b7 i think
your euid can definitely can still be 0
ios 7 ipsw has encrypted rootfs
and if the device has never changed versions
unless you save an onboard blob
cameren detected!!!!
then you will save it for the signed firmwares
save them
you just
not right away at least
nice filter
mostly data tbh
then no more upgrading to 14.8
for that device
do you happen to have 14.8 blob then
cameren lurking
it is
what jailbreak are you currently on
asking because shshd
does a12 has rose
well actually
not possible
would restored external be happy with that
no i need to get rid of autocarrot
like the main cpu
and that requires a matching nonce too
entangled nonce i mean
on that coprocessor
set a nonce
be able to
you would need to
too many names
why do i keep messing up stuff
eh that would require a rose exploit
oh also __data_const is protected by ktrr
just make sure the check data is in __data_const
they could hardcode a version check
and not using dpkg deb arch
how did we get to the point of mixing arm and arm64 packages
you need to specify suites and components
reserve i search
easy packing
xcodebuild
wen eta ipad calculator
no the point is
all resources
i have a website that is smaller than 5 kb
for a bootrom exploit
pay you $0
apple will literally
sounds right to me
capt moment

checkra1n is more stable

hi flower
electra is very meh
that's just sip stuff
should be possible
too many flowers
happy birthday
i closed all the prs again
buy it
launchd is a custom binary
battery usage
u forgot 2
for more than 6 months
well it is mostly because i single-handedly
unless you have certain roles
to bypass
super easy
it is
trusted sources
unless you have certain roles
without pateron
i can use altstore discord
does it not work
how about 100 apple tvs and 100 apple watches
even better
100 devices of each type
altserver-linux
eh just buy an actual dev account then
wen eta ipad calculator
ipad calculator
that gets revoked
not sort of
well it exists
happens first
checkm8
unless
there is
why invisible
there are 4 flower
flower 6999
there is lol
then do it
skull emoji
actually meh is an exaggeration
very meh android
you should be stkc
there android posting
saily
how do i be more flower like
is that system that dumb
too real
plus passcode
i have a11 14.4 unjailbroken
there are intel and  arm64e
as if it is an actual mac
then you should be able to do it
not supported
and have kexts injected into it
normal macos patched in memory
although amd still has amd issue
with working usb obviously
which has usb a ports
then do the actual restore and boot from another linux machine
i would need to generate the files on macos
well i have mac
i can handle it myself
i have a9x a11 m1 pro
not on a9x
already found the guide
m1 pro
i have t6000
but was flagged apparently
nvm found it
and that tethered downgrade post got deleted
need to make restored_external happy otherwise
then what do i do
but change it so that it uses all the storage
can i just mock dualbootfun
how do i do tethered downgrade again
and some wires
and i think checkm8 can be triggered using a signal generator
ra1npoc
just stuff it links to
technically it is just "iphone"
there it is
there's no iphone 2
i may close all the prs
then pacless died on 15
for the most part of pacless
as well as odyssey and taurine
from u0
has been released
nothing about pacless
(u0 jbd)
substituted was never open source
then u0 dark happened
use a version mismatched dyld
but compiled as dyld
~~compile a custom dyld~~
can dyld be non-platform
custom libraries worked for bash
it did said about the reverse though
nowhere did it said anything like that
eh you should read the tos again
oversized ipod touch
why is the dimensions like that
is this the iphad
iphad
a14 14.4b1 is not jailbreakable
because
actually
where designer
checkra1n
why fr
isn't it libplist-2-0
fiore designer now?????
broken packages
or chimera
just restore rootfs with checkra1n
then fix it even though you can't with your skill level
man really tried to install arm package on arm64
id rather update my prs first
watch some stuff break because there are http 1.1 only servers
it says something about 32 bit arm
it also looks like mcapollo repo for some reason
restore rootfs
aarch32
just use a mostly static procursus ldid
how is that related
eh yes by downloading a static bin
how. to modify it then
trustcache
what do you mean
can i test in a vm
and all security nuked on that one
i have another macos install with dev kernel
im on macos 12.4 arm64
but then exec don't work on dyld
as the resigned launchd
it is the same issue
need a debugger attached
yes that should fix
on ubuntu
who wrote that script
so you only have ios 14 and 15
does checkra1n not work for that
does login work on rootless now
no dyld: setting comm page to whatever
dyld didn't launch
and fake launchd is resigned with same cert
can you get some serial output
just patch dyld
so no
skill issue
and that certainly gets task ports
and have it work
i can spawn a modified taurine
just with a lot of catches
ok nvm because i already have it
how much for ios 14 untether
procursus by cameron
altstore is fine i think
while violating licenses
on the site
with no random character
just developerdisks.json
not connected
oh also
not 7 letters
scorpio
amazing
inject libraries
no, not that
the tweak dev is dumb
it should kernel data abort soon anyways
actually
reboot
when the process is in the suspended state, yes
why does ios apps crash when they are updated
airdrop signed ipa
how about xcode
set date back method works there too
how often is it for a cert to not be a chinese cert
why so many chinese certs
aka where amfi starts existing
it could go down to iphone os 1.2b1
but uh
it goes down to ios 8 at least
probably
psychic paper certainly works there
why psychic paper
also i found your minecraft house
which is like a micrale at that point
not too long ago
enterprise certs?
apple virtual machine 1 (virtualmac2,1)
they have no sep uses standard arm64 stuff like psci and uses less apple instructions
because
than any other variant
vma2 should be much easier
asus memopad 7
wen eta vma2 macos on random arm64 hardware
incompatible sep
which has armv8.1 instructions
1 gb physical ram but upper 512 mb is for ans2 cache
1 gb storage
no armv8.1 and armv8.3 instructions
but yes a lot of stuff goes through t2
note: t2 is the main cpu on these devices
not on the intel coprocessor
on the main cpu
i mean like
give devicetree
linux on t2 itself wen
or at least bad
they suck on 16kb pages
but the microsoft-qualcomm contract though
apple is fine on that afaik
they need to have better processor than those qcom makes
macos on arm64e is totally fine
woa objectively sucks
not if you are on arm64
windows btw macos btw
debian btw ubuntu btw
you mean debian unstable ?
or rather
never
why not reboot userspace
empty list
u0 has relatively better exploit success rates
pacman
there
apt the best
ios 11 libhooker
not libhooker
but still
man just posted his environment
(it is correct now)
use console.app on macos
console.app
for multicast_bytecopy
plus it does have a license violation
i still likes to say filza redacted
you can try to abuse stuff with filza redacted
so theoretically
btw replacing calculator and calendar should work too
but especially so on a15
well it is on all devices
on a15 it is kernel panic machine
does permasingner works for sideload
hook whatever the actual launchd is instead
the userspace reboot would unjailbreak the device
~~i totally bootlooped 3 times to figure out how to do it correctly~~
for my skill level anyways
there isn't much to do after that
in fact fugu14 can't use tweaks at all
the ios 13 one i mean
fugu is semi-tethered
everyone knows cameron runs procursus
id say static compilation
libirestore is?
(you updated usbmuxd2, which strictly speaking is not libimobiledevice)
fr isn't in there
how about fr
fr bounce slow
why is sileo nightly failing to build with absolutely no error messages
sileo nightly github actions
fail without any error messages
easier than pmset
theoretically anyways
and also setup a scheduled github action that pulls in upstream
so just ignore that
just hack on the github action
with the ios 15 one
inb4 calculator gets replaced
you have ios 14 boobs
idk why it is named like that
i mean fractions
how about the vulgar emotes
hi worf
evasi0n i suppose
still typing lol
am i allowed to use it
how many phones did you get
backup the activation records
first thing to do with a phone without passcode
why is it still typing
how do i make isdeviceabrick returns false
the concept of throwing away stuff exists legally in many regions
not really
with fmi enabled
probably no passcode phone
ish can
ish can have background session very good
use hterm.js
can confirm
wen eta ipad calculator
macos zebra
i would resign newterm 3 in that case
what is a dw
for ios 15
use the firmware boot menu instead
even on monterey
how about clover
springboard 3d
powermac?
what are you doing
they are
and remove the speaker it is as well
but can also be used to track people
people trying to stalk you#
how about cryptex1 ticket
1conan
just ios 15.5 blobs
you can
i have no idea whether userspace reboot will call fakelaunchd
it is just that jailbreakd is dead
userspace reboot works
and i mean
there's no issue with that
launchctl can
because ldrestart actually userspace reboot
even if the jailbreak somehow worked
it will break ldrestart and lh config
taurine breaks
untethered
so yes your custom code can be pid 1
the real launchd can't be resigned appearently
com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit
without
that's only true
the name is different
hayden spotting in the wild
ios 15
on m1 ipad you can use like 10 gb
but it is nothing lol
haxx has 90
wil shop channel
pretty sure the real mac address isn't burned in
syscfg
yes with bputil thing
someone should ping detour in 931437948094795796
wen kernel-text-access
feature
that's stock ios
1.5 seconds of reaction time after unlock
so like
because no internet in bfu
you will have some time to react though
that's stock ios
so better block them with a router
what's with ppq
just restore a modded backup
brand new iphone 13
like, brand new
it would be brickstate=true
even a new one
for every device that haven't went through setup
brickstate is always true
you don't
odyssyen1x master now has linux-apple
and then ya know, taurine permanent
on taurine
and i told hayden how to abuse it
coretrust
how would i know? because i am able to abuse it
one of the exploit is very simple to abuse, yes
for like two years
comes out of nowhere and drops a jb
pwn has been like that
it is garbage indeed
price issue
someone got filtered
they are free iirc
jtv is gone
nah, that was the old account
and the key is derived from random string for each build+uid key+gid key
and the key changes every version
or encrypt the mailbox messages
ah yes giving away a
and patch ld64 to do it as well
go ahead resign every .deb with that cert
because nothing ever needs it
amfid wouldn't run at all tight?
theoretically if jailbreakd uses the ct bypass cert
im not sure if coedsign works on dscs...
and patch out some of the libmis stuff
how about resigning dsc instead
simplest way to test is just resign dyld
it should
because you can't just execve the real one
but replacing dyld is even more anonying than replacing launchd
go ahead, replace dyld
this untether is simpler than fugu14 and support more devices
then stuff gets tricky
snes9x license
i love license violations
iphone 7 plus users:
not very hard on linux and macos
it should be jailbroken by default
get a bash shell on ios 16 and call it a day
it has a textual framebuffer
unless you enable verbose boot
the normal apple logo is drawn by iboot
without graphics acceleration
the only image ios can draw
ok to sum it up
everything else only has a metal renderer
unlike android rooting
in most jailbreaks
but you only take over a tiny portion of the system
being tethered itself already indirectly makes them uncommon
you did
deteor got member pro
nflower
there
jazzy detected
eh 15.4.1 is not as screwed as 15.5
binary
probably because jbd is ded
it userspace reboot and unjailbreaks you
with replaced launchd
taurine is utterly borked
i can confirm
and the ios driver is dumb enough to allow dcp to access arbitrary physical memory
dcp can be popped on 14.6
14.6 has lower technical difficulty
eh, id say 14.6 is a bit better
so it is super obvious
print a banner 10 times
a custom binary that forks then execve the real launchd and some haxx
plus that code is outdated already
average geo moment
and have it work in stock
figured out how to replace launchd
does originnal launchd needs to be resigned
then it can be said that launchd cannot be replaced
it's not set in stone unless that binary runs in normal stock mode
how would that work
i think it has to do with can allow non platform
need a control set up
and then it panics
i mean the kernel
patched or not
so it will sigkill
and launchd is unsigned there
it will load the checkra1n ramdisk
if you rd=md0
this is still unpatched xnu
did it say anything special before that
huh ok
but you need to skip the checkra1n ramdisk
you can boot unpatched verbose with pongo
procursus ldid master
use ldid
it would
so i can only assume it works
also, verbose boot didn't work on vmapple
launchd.c
which is probably because i passed argv as is
just ssv and boot args restrictions are disabled
note that sip + amfi is still enabled
now on an idevice... but ehh it is like 1 am here
the macos vm that has its launchd replaced boots fine
where
com.apple.private.amfi.can-allow-non-platform
and platform-application is not platform code
before it could run
must be allowed by launchd
i think non platform code
launchd should be happy about that
move the real launchd to
im going to
actually
sip is still enabled
meh its just a macos vm with boot args and ssv disabled
and ill just pass through argc and argv
i think
it has to be pid 1
because vmapple moment
although some stuff may be borked
in a macos 12.3.1
replacing launchd
im going to
i can do it in virtualapple
just need to use another cert
the bug works on macos 12.3.1 and below
i can try it on macos first
did replacing launchd work then
so it at least exists
just no eta
i guess
ipad mini 2
and that failed
tvos jailbreak has a single point of failure
when can smokin get blue role
and the malformed cert is from zhang
why not just use posix spawn persona
why does sileo use setuid in givemeroot
did i just describe node_modules
and depends of depends should have their own module directory too
no more conflicts
best system
each project should have their own module directory
ceo of fake
btw, i know of another bug that would also do that same thing that isn't public yet
they are bugs because they did not check whether the binary being executed is a platform binary
and another one is just a shebang trick with mount
one of them is fileproviderctl
there are only 2 bugs
the second one probably worked until process-exec-interpreter was restricted in some ios version
i really like fileproviderctl_internal
as far as codesigning goes
just factorise those mf public keys in every apple device
you know what will help jailbreaking? faster factorisation
just have to sign those as well
just very risky
springboard may work
what do you want to do
internal stuff i think
just cal libapt-pkg6.0
yes, just invalid
that contains all the information you would want
eh, just curl the packages file
how do i delete a nvram variable in iboot
this is so hard to find
where is nebula
jailbroken
that is smooth
i have a jailbroken 2 gb ram device
not really
sounds like a memory leak
not really
you are stuck on 13.7 or update to 15.5
eh just set clock gates to ridiculous values
most of it
i suppose sun never shines 24 hours a day in your region then
wiping syscfg rn
i meant latitude
htrowii should be from a lower latitude
it is a direct translation
apple mobile file integrity
very meh
which runs cicuta_virosa
actually not debug fileproviderctl_internal
i have newterm to debug some fileproviderctl_internal stuff
no, on 14.3
setuid is borked in stock
i have newterm working
eh with task_for_pid-allow you probably can debug yourself
a debugged must be attached
get task allow
is just
jitterbug
with task_for_pid-allow
call task_for_pid() on yourself
just a little exception
it is
hypervisor -
and i think that can be rwx
you can use a virtual cpu to do jit on ipad pro m1
uh, uh a10+ i think
i think
also it still cannot write and execute at the same time
dynamic-codesigning
it's rooted in gba4ios
delta on pro
maybe
ig it should be as portable as openssl is
if it exists
but it really should use the hardware instructions
~~echo clang -x c ldid a.out~~
well ig it can be kept for portability
ldid links to openssl
no it is bundled with macos
codesign is actually bundled with macos i think
how about assert(false)
because paid developer accounts exists
certtool and security is open source
entitlements
does not have
by defintion
an unsigned binary
`ldid -e`
there's a ldid3?
you should install it from pip3 instead
you are stupid
hack different ipwndfu
how hard could it be
just detach it
this is a real errno
errno = eownerdead;
actually
errno = 2;
give_ios_15_jb();
just must not depend on xcode stuff
having theos is fine
actually
without theos i mean
need to figure out a way to build newterm on linux
problem solved
just have newterm be a bootstrap package
because the location of rootless files are not guaranteed
better be dynamic
actually
statically
so it uses the rootless files instead
a future version of libiosexec will intercept it
that will have the advantage of libiosexec intercepting it
sounds right
master.passwd
ps1 would be utterly broken
my default shell is not zsh
euid cannot be set with posix spawn
had to use the posix spawn apis because seteuid is broken
with whatever argument that is passed
i have it posix spawn the real login with uid = 0
and setuid being borked
tetherbootx32
there is one
tns is 64 bit only
ah yes, taurine ...
this is jailed
volume up should be reserved for safe mode
nvram is the fugu14 disable method
just have to resign like 500 machos and make a login shim
can confirm that it is possible to make newterm work correctly in jailed mode
u mean mandarin
fugu is a type of fish
although this would require resigning even more binaries
this include the fugu14 kernel exploit too
for exploit
since it can give itself whatever entitlement needed
can use the appleave2 bug too
oob_events works on 13.5
same issue as taurine permanent
+ it fails the first time
but no indication until you turn on the screen
without it it would still jailbreak - by definition a untether must be able to do it
so you can see the userspace reboot splash
that's to keep the screen on
i tried that on newterm
how do l speii hydrate
hi fiower
l'm bored
i is shorter than l
it's not the same
there are powershell for linux
swift ewww
which is oss
there's also tihmstar launchd
it isn't
not into checkra1n launchd
plus it's just taurine 1.1.0
i revealed my hand elsewhere already
should have been plain c
jailbreakd very fun
good luck writing jbd
please chill
(the end)
actually the fileproviderctl_internal binary
he removed stuff
this is just ct bug (so real untether) + spv fake untether + taurine
it is the exact same problem
same issue with taurine-permanent
it is
it takes like 2 minutes
the jailbreak is too slow
pretty much
just use safe mode
to avoid resigning
to flex
ik so no nick chan jb anytime soon
i would like to
and spotting entitlement issues
although i described the fileproviderctl_internal method
i did not write code for this thing
before first unlock
can confirm taurine splash screen works bfu
no wonder it is heating up
please stop
i will just keep the screen on
actually
any good recommendations
i should get a lockscreen tweak
so it is all black screen\
when it userspace reboot
i didn't keep the screen on
it is just that
it works bfu
k ill unlock it
because that would require user interaction
then it isn't an untether
in bfu
it's broke
still nothing
as long as the unix permissions are fine
and how to debug this without using a serial cable
it didn't bootloop my ipad at least
bfu, no reaction yet
and stays there for 2 minutes
im smarter
why is flower a genius
the jailbreak will just be tethered
you can do it with checkm8
you can only mknod in it
not all of them are user ids
rootfs has always been read only on stock
ehhh if you don't give your custom stuff`com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes` it should be fine
yes you can
giving everything com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes sounds unfunny
they would have minus storage
you can use checkra1n
ldid needs a patch i think
nonce. setter was broken
some bypasses were broken
there is
this very much does have user noticable effects
they accepted the tfp0 mess in ios 14
they accepted no untether
but people accepted kppless
i can
not on 16 gb devices for obvious reasons
so yes it could work non-checkm8
more like 700 mb
bind mounts does not take 5gb
copying all files
it is just
tihmstar isn't taking about bind mounts
i hate it
please no bind mounts
bridgeos and audioos is fine
tvos is fat enough
(also bridgeos and audioos but no one care about those)
other whateveros
unless you count
that takes about ~ 700 mb of space
just do bindfs
no space wasted
unionfs.kext
macos arm64 ig
what is redacted suppose to be
redacted?
system+system data
at least it is like that on 15b1
the system volume does not take 14 gb
bindfs can work on 16 gb
14 gb is system+other
system+other
uh around 14 gb
if you don't rename the snapshot
you can reboot
don't rename the snapshot
jailbreak
do minecraft hardcore mode
bindfs
just operate on the disk device
and root hash has been there since 14.0
this is ios 14
and reboot
just modify the raw filesystem directly
and ibss can do it on a10 and above
iboot and ibec does recovery mode
like you can't set com.apple.system.boot-nonce
but there are restrictions
needs to be unsandboxed already i think
it isn't a restricted var
that should work
that's the point really, so you can set it in recovery mode if you bootloop
and you are unsandboxed as long as you have no sandbox entitlements
and no_untether is not a restricted variable
reading should be fine
fugu14 has it
wen no_untether via nvram
not for initial testing
please don't
then suddenly userspace reboot
it will just be on lockscreen for like 1 minute
technically speaking
not affected
just exec ldid then
where
not jailbroken moment
although by this definition even fugu14 fast. untether is slow
was referring to some pattern-f stuff
nvm then
does it happen to use pre-jailbreak
is it based on anyhting
and yes i have a9x 14.3
how would you test it
and semi bootloop the device
else it would run every userspace reboot
make sure to test is jailbroken
ultra slow untether = those that does not complete even after lockscreen shows up
ultra slow untether
already exists
i have postmarketos on a9x too
see how it detects a debugger
syscall tracing-
a custom hypervisor
unc0ver is obfuscated so
a jailbreak wouldn't trigger a "trojan" detection
blob for your specific phone ecid on that version
ye it would require setting up a captive wifi
webkit bug is sufficient
does normal apticket has cryptex1
and i think a patched ldid needs to be used on 15
it should be
don't see why it wouldn't be on it
dont think so
can i jailbreak ios 15.5
adding instructions to fix fileproviderctl after applying my haxx
can confirm
you cannot
useless now anyways
13.5 blobs are like
cryptex1 tickets
because
someone needs to test
does 16 blobs even work
can be used to restore to 15.5
that's a 15.5 blob
just. do the relative path trick
seceee
codesign works for 14
what is a dork
skull
very real
xina tested it
this is a known fact
which reveals whether a path exists
they can only check the errno
they can't read
enoent vs eperm
that's true
in there
i used spv's stuff
and mostly not being actually able to read
jailbreak detection is mostly about eperm vs enoent
what happens if i resign the entire strap
that's true for any untethered jb
or rather launchctl load it
i can make my haxx execute that
resign that?
the log file getting appended
and it shows my untethered haxx in action
not you didnt
use blobsaver
ios 10 background??
hi haxi69
bigboss is a dist repo
works with passcode on btw
got that strat from fugu14
also, this replace analyticsd
and that you want could be a jailbreak
it runs unsandboxed + untethered as root
`haxx.c` can be modified to do whatever you want
sorry for my absolutely ugly c code
please base64 decode
so my haxx is launched
posix spawn
ok now lemme do the persona mgmt stuff
at least for fileproviderctl_internal
but yes
doesn't have to be in an .app actually
u said 14.8
just use posix spawn to spawn a. root copy of yourself
not needed
analyticsd runs as _analyticsd
note: launchd doesn't work
just replace analyticsd  (or other daemons) with fileproviderctl
the exploit payload
no need to be inside an app
worth doing badly
wdb has an example on how to do that
time to look at wdb again
and another function call
coolstar gave me some tips
with posix_spawn
next is to get setuid working
since ct is part of kernel
technically it is kernel exploit
idk, i wrapped it inside an .app
(that's ish btw)
even though i deleted it before reboot
that file exists
lemme check fileproviderctl_internal.log
so ig i need to jb the device next
it is not super important anyways
just don't launch analyticsd.back ig
analyticsd is broken no wonder
but aren't we trusted
when launched from springboard
the custom binary certainly works
so you suggest me to chmod 777 that file
it is
how would launchd work then
the backup analyticsd is launched
that's the real thing
we are trying to do fileproviderctl_internal
and compile and sign fileproviderctl_internal
replace analyticsd with fileproviderctl
lemme see if that work
i make it so that fileproviderctl_internal can also be run from springboard
i have an idea
preboard.app
replace
maybe
unless
springboard.app replacement anyone??
when not jailbroken
does not exist
nothing happens
so no verbose
analyticsd is launched right before lockscreen start
actually no
im poor
can i use checkra1n bootux
don't have it
and idk how to debug this stuff
didn't work
i tried fileproviderctl_internal
i cant get fileproviderctl_internal to launch unjailbroken
iphone os 1 does not have blobs
not really copyrightable
probably
a subset of anything is enough
do something
not anything
it also does dfu mode
and some read only memory checks for bootloader stage 1
amd bootloader stage one checks for stage 2
because the bootloader stage 2 checks for it
i can try later
yes no one
well, there is still one know way
cs_platform
which is the worse case
the phones dies without checkra1n
actually what device
are your device on arm64e
if it fails
ideally get logs out of console.app
always fail first time
try again
as if taurine on stock
well it works on macos too
it is a logic bug
it makes sense to think so
i don't see why it wouldn't
every time i messes something up
i dont want to checkra1n --force-revert
and that saves you some time
60 seconds untether
desired anyways
fake untether stuff
just replace launchd
ios 13
it wouldn't launch nonjb
no idea why
the second time it works fine
when taurine is installed with the ct exploit for me the first try will in jailbreak always result in taurine not able to get amfid task port
intermediate cert is still checked for though
should work when run with no args
not exploitable without jb
ct just check it, happy with it, and just approve it without asking amfid
pretty sure amfid checks it properly on 14
huh interesting
you can if you make sure you have a working ssh ramdisk
and even be able to replace launchd appearently
what does nbd mean
so it makes codesign effectively useless
and ct somehow checks against that one when you do that
because it embeds a root certificate within the signature
so you can just make your own root cert & valid signatures
the bug is that if you specify a root certificate inside the code signature, it will verify the signature against that one
is just that you can use codesign with it
the reason to add it to the macos keychain
this is super easy
i did it first anyways
hi there
i believe it has to do with fast path
and amfid is not running
so validating it will just fail since it is not in the trustcache
there is no ct fast path
or our malformed cert
like adhoc + trustcache
so it must be signed with something that ct can handle
so just replace it
launchd has some restrictions about binaries it execute
so does it work
without your entitlements
syntax error
and ct is introduced in 12
and 12
password is password
sounds like something that can be done in 5 min
force is needed to replace an existing signature
but ldid is somehow borked i think
the args are right
i only tried codesign
does ldid work
probably not
since you asked
it works
an untether bug is cool
i save blobs with shortcut automatically
then replace a system daemon with it
wen cli version of taurine
he has a 14 device
do filza
rip it from the rdsk
i can rip one off an ipsw ig
but still crashes
and there is no coretrust fast path on 12
only coretrust is
amfid is not vulnerable on 12
using the share button
get the entire line
when it doesn't mention amfi i know something is off
should be different now
can you grab the console.app log again
after reboot?
the dumbest reason
afc2 moment
that was like
the actual executable
i mean
cuz it might be due to that
make sure it is permission 755
also you should use the share button to get the entire line
are you sure that the permissions are 755
but it works the second time you jailbreak
it will 100% fail the first time (unable to get amfid task port)
also more info on the perma signed taurine
keychain-access-groups: not ok
although it should be fine
consider changing the team identifier and application identifier
now compare it to yours
this is what i posted
i definitely did not post the no container entitlement
actually no
maybe i posted wrong thing
invalid plists
on ios 12
the only explanation
seems to be signed correct
on the mac
and try the whole thing again
use error and faults tab
and try to find any lines that says amfi
once chimera crashes disconnect the device
stream the ios system log
it exists
open console.app
to the mac
uh can you connect the phone
ok so
well make sure it is not the installed one
so a wall plug is fine
the cable just have to be powered on
then run checkra1n in cli mode on the macbook
to enter dfu
you can use a wall plug
drm will fail
of course
because installd is not vulnerable
you can use odysseyra1n
now chimera will have a stroke if you unsandbox it so we keep it sandboxed
untethered (below 15) + unsandboxed (arbitrary entitlements) perma sign
install normal ipa
yeah the unzipped .app should not be the installed .app
you will need to use the pwned ipa on your mac
also this is kernel-rw-less amfi bypass
plus installd is not vulnerable
sideloadly will replace the existing signature
with a fresh rootfs
well you get unjailbroken
of checkra1n
it just put you into the pre-bootstrap stage
it still jailbreaks
this jailbreaks you
ios 14 has additional checks for non-native
hm ok then
are you actually non jailbroken
remove some entitlements ig
without restore rootfs
you can still see if you can open chimera
filza has tons of entitlements
it will
and you need the proper entitlements
yes, may need to codesign some helper binaries though
and call it a day
and yes you can codesign the entire bootstrap
you can sign any jailbroken app you want with this bug
the .app
although the bug still physically exist in coretrust on 12
fast path is a requirement to exploit this on 12-14
on 15 both amfid and coretrust is vulnerable
verification must succeed in coretrust to exploit this
(on 15-15.4 ssv makes it impossible to untether)
11 got another untether bug anyways
coretrust doesn't exist on ios 11
with instructions of course
ok it works i have zero reason to keep the normal taurine
it isn't
and it works on a9x
probably? this is a logic bug
password is password
got u0+fugu14 but better
actually just unlucky, jb works
but anyways download the p12 and add it to your keychain
you use `codesign(1)`
taurine has a stroke when installed like this
with codesign?
this is so simple to exploit
because we can fake platform-application already
we can just replace a daemon
actually we don't even need this
since we have codesign bypass here
to get actual untether
(although on 15 it is mitigated by ssv)
can probably be combined with the fake untether bugs
but yes
it did not show the x
anyways the result is like u0+fugu14
camera moment
wait this did not show that taurine is system app
k, hope i don't bootloop
codesign bypass + auto execution
some config_logo something
never tried that
time to make some penguins appear on my ipad
changed
ktrr is the real thing
it is fundamentally flawed
kpp is trash
but services are still borked
and yes tweaking is enabled
it works if i reboot userspace
and trying to start libhooker will make launchd exit
and yes newterm works
daemons
no tweak injection and services
which will put you into a half-jailbroken state if jailbroken previously
turns out tihmstar's ramdisk can be booted on 14.3
just don't rename the snapshot
on ios 15
and not bootloop
you can still write to the actual rootfs
actually
it's getting somewhere'\
im still trying to build sillyo nightly in github actions
not zebra 1
i suppose
zebra alpha (?)
do it when she's online
which isn't that difficult to remove
and remove depictionkit
change it
just hack on the github action files then
beg small boobs to give you access
just not really related to sillyo
actually it isn't that dead
a dead channel
sileo nightly
im in the most-public-private channel
i need to figure out how to peek on sileo private channels
i can confirm that coolstar isn't dead
and then install twerks
install zefram with zebra
the standard dfu restore boot args
it's supposed to be a boot args filter
apple decided that verbose mode isn't a security issue
since macos 12.4
and yes setting verbose works with full security
because recovery is always full security
that's it in recovery
or clear it
you can set verbose
nvram boot-args
:trollfront:
install asahi linux
which also isn't particularly hard to do
patching kernel source yes
if you do that on development
launchd will have a stroke
even on development
but mount-phase-2 will fail
i also tried to force root live fs with rd=
because i want more boot-args
wdt is watchdog
does what it suggests
disable codesigning
does it not work on development
-v keepsyms=1 debug=0x14e wdt=-1 launchd_unsecure_cache=1 launchd_missing_exec_no_panic=1 amfi=0xff amfi_allow_any_signature=1 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 amfi_unrestrict_task_for_pid=1 cs_enforcement_disable=1 -unsafe_kernel_text dtrace_dof_mode=1 allow-root-hash-mismatch=1
sussy bootargs
dev kernel
sip off
i have another install that nukes all security
on the nornal install
i use reduced
so you can do full security downgrades
set a boot nonce
hsp4.kext doesn't work anymore
it's not too hard
patch out the tfp0 checks
and the first step needs to be in normal mode, obviously
this must be done in recoveryos
that can be installed with kmutil configure-boot
makes a t6000 development kernelcache from the kdk
no need lol
please test on development
only works on development
i just do bputil -nckas
no ktrr
makes kernel text unsafe
btw -unsafe_kernel_text is enabled
with kasan
-enable-kprintf-spam
need to patch kernel maybe
kernel task port is not allowed even on development
does not work
how do i set nonce on apple silicon macos again
works on iphone 3g
of the shortcut
by editing some xml files
not jailbroken
setup can be opened with a shortcut
how about mounting on setup.app
frozen nonce + matching saved ios 14 blobs + on a12 + on ios 15
technically you can make ios 15 jb that can write to (the original) rootfs with checkm8
heavily mitigated though
there are
virtualbox is ew
or su
like even the first time i tried to use sudo
it never confused me
for security reasons
nothing getting shown != characters not being read
i have 8 gb phones
16 gb iphone 6s
probably
we at hack different trying to do t2 linux
actually, his family member made the merch
not possible
do note that that person did nothing wrong though
absolutely horrible timing
it is tho
please make it work for both scp 8.x and 9.x
the electron app before electron
by freezing them
so logically the thing after w would be x
xorg is called xorg because there was a w window system
sounds like a facebook bug
microsoldering
get a serial breakout then
playing along
please consider not exposing yourself
psychic paper works on ios 8
the "please use another device" issue? no

i want to use clang and llvm
i want to run fast vms
beta alert
checkra1n
does mac has the 3 app limit
although tvos substrate will probably work?
there is no tweak injector for audioos
audioos jailbreaking
!t roblox
also this is the reason why we have
there is
wrong accessory id
then try a dfu restore
are you downloading the firmware while the screen is black
dfu mode is black screen
which is between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0
if you are wondering this is build 170
how about leaking checkra1n
maybe with diags?
then somehow make ibec jumps to the pongo image
to load all the restore components
so closest would be
then after iboot loads everything jumps back to pongo
then the shellcode jumps to iboot
and have that shellcode patch iboot such that it jumps back to pongo once it ran
it's closest to the actual checkra1n boot flow
although that actually doesn't work
you should load raw (not macho) pongo as ibec instead
i tried loaded pongo raw as ibec too
that's a you issue
we need to apply an aix hack fix
from linux-apple
build a 16k kernel
test it
framebuffer partially trips
aic is tripping on a11
smp doesn't work on all devices
a11 aic fix
3 words
and yes plists are xmls
some xml here
that's what xml looks like so
x11 icons
xml is like text plists
can you make on for xml then
not in sileo stable at least
where
did you
python, perl, localizations, lua, math, keyrings, x11
looks like a sileo bug
instead of the section default
when there is no icon
it always uses the fallback default icon
section icons does not work on the featured page
change youtube-dl to yt-dlp
ik what to change on the macos page
actually
that's mostly because there is nothing to feature
just make it like the macos featured page
repo name is `label: ` in `release` i think
also lol unnamed procursus
some sort of file manager
since that actually has a gui
i think replacing accord with xfe will do
if they can somehow not depend on tweaks
everything else exists
more codesign issues
you just said it
accord is nonexistent
remove nonexistent stuff
it shows up on the macos sileo featured page
which repo is accord in
what is the accord repo (macos)
no betas though
skull emoji
that's right before 23 cameren vanished
plus a few months ago = me nonexistent
sileo better
saily dead though
and less annoying stuff
general is where most of the good stuff happen
so to build sileo i need to reverse engineer depictionkit right?
that is not a deb , that url has long been changed to something else
advertisers
you only need special stuff for apple tv 4k and homepod
remains best way to nuke security
but that probably requires writing a custom kext
so maybe need to patch launchd instead?
but launchd mount-phase-2 will fail
trying to force live mount with rd= would actually boot to userspace
now it would still mount the root snapshot
is a setup with development kernel + nvram root-live-fs=1 sip off authenticated root off permissive security
mounting rootfs writable while running probably needs a kernel patch
i tried
apple silicon - development kernel with sip on - sounds like a terrible idea
you flashed iso with rufus?
he had issues with nvidia stuff
looks like we have several conversations here and yall mixing them up
this is supposed to be run inside ish on the target device
should work if target device is ios 14
(odysseyn1x is linux too, just stripped down)
and you can do that in the live environment
that should have better drivers
well that generates a pairing file
plus can you show more lines
has the checkra1n user interface been displayed
this is running checkra1n already right?
because it showed nvidia stuff in backtrace
can you try unplugging nvidia graphics card
and blobs for a certain device can only be used on the same device (same ecid)
please note that blobs are device specific
and after that supposely i can do full security downgrades?
and i think i can set the nonce if i goes to permissive security and disable nvram protection
also you can dump onboard blobs if you jailbreak it with checkra1n
shsh2
is this se 1 gen by any chance
which you do not have
that's called a blob
and iphone 3g
it's a thing for iphone 2g
or updating to anything that's not latest (mostly)
and not you cannot downgrade
you can't use that file if the upgrade goes south
i also tried xcode + ios app signer it would just say unable to install
i changed the apple id name to my real legal name
that's the placeholder
but the team name is still the placeholder
then i changed it later to a proper one
when i made the apple id
it was some placeholder first name and last name
the team name
also, is there any way to rename
(recent = 12 days ago)
and google leads to recent unanswered stackoverflow questions
like mine
on certain "messed up (idk)" devices
it can be reproduced with free accounts
i don't have dev account either
actually never sideloaded since reset all contents and settings
there are no sideloaded apps on this device
there it is
i can try to make one rq
aka need to build one
is that there is no ios jitterbugpair builds
the trickiest thing is
that's still a router
no router = no wifi
i mean the router
usually you can find that in the router admin panel
that supports upnp
and the phone must be connected to wifi
ish can work for that
since altserver-linux can handle anisette
any good?
very plausible
unless sideloadly anisette api
anisette data though
you think i don't understand
i have it on my ipad
and zsign definitely
why would they... not
zsign and ideviceinstaller i suppose
change name pls
also stop asking
i think you can force ra1npoc to work on macos arm64
this mbp goes up to around 65 degree c in my use case
u-boot nvme is borked i think
but some stuff like linux-apple needs linux as well
and i need the performance
im buying it for macos

idevicerestore master can restore ios 16
just do not have enough stuff
they aren't invalid per se
aka all ios 16 blobs right now is insufficient
just make a new field for it
another ticket for another dmg in the ipsw
like sep
and this cannot be mismatched
cryptex1 ticket
wouldn't ios 16 blobs requires a cryptex1 ticket as well?
regardless of the exact method
maybe
just because it does not print anything does not mean it did nothing
it did
could be due to mismatched library version, idk

how do i generate package diffs
then uncompressed
and lpm would be lz4
without blowing up the phone
xz -zvc --lzma2=preset=9e,dict=100mb,mf=bt4,mode=normal,nice=273,depth=1000 gives best compression anyways
we need to have compression switch in sileo
to make stuff faster
procursus is doing exactly the same thing
procursus
`packages` is the fastest to decompress
that depends on how many packages as well
package.lzma
package.lz4
which one
the command is not
well the on disk structure is simple
cpio is simple
cpio is also ok
getting a ratio of 0.2 is easy
lzma2 compression is very strong
how is 7zip proprietary
better than getting cut off
odysseyra1n is the best

true you can boot without userland modifications
just make it tethered - oh wait no itunes update will still give access
it makes a fake passcode

the bbnonce needs to somehow match

also, due to devhelper, binfmt must also be registered for something like this
it has less issues than a vm
im not sure about the qemu user space emulation part
no, there are no powerpc builds ~~unless qemu-i386 is somehow usable for checkra1n~~
well technically checkra1n can be used on a crappy arm64 board
in lost+found
of files
why is there 954mb
frbig1frbig3
not on a14 14.4b1
img4tool needs to have the com.apple.private.security.disk-device-access entitlement and has an effective user id of 0
it is just that the output is the same
and it is technically not the same
that's because disk1 does not exist
img4tool --convert -s blob.shsh2 disk1
how do i save onboard blobs from a dumped disk1
!t blobs
webkit should be better imo
emerge chromium
chromium-
the deps takes way longer to build
like 15 minutes, but
24 hours is my max time i can wait btw
12 hours?
how long does it takes to build llvm 13
do they have signature checks
are you using a dev ibss
it was very active for like 10 days
you are out of luck with go
machine not in a state diags expected
jumping to the wrong address
that means ibss jumped to the diags image
basically that
ibss is done
that means that it tried to load it
right
with an im4m
you need to
img4 -i diag.raw -o diag.img4 -a -t ibec -m some-im4m
pack it back into an img4 then
no idea
i think
img4 -i diag.im4p -o diag.img4 -t ibec -m some-im4m
set the tag
your img4 needs to be type of ibec
is it type ibec
then what did you use
after sending that diags command
you need to sign diag.img4 with an im4m
oh wait we are past that
siguza, axi0mx
yeah checkra1n team is like two people right now
it's not "the checkra1n guy" just yet
there are like 2 people
checkra1n team
tihmstar
you just can't download them
well technically it exists
or am i missing something here
then modify ppl-protected kernel memory with a rop chain
when it is done
and then it is very flincky
and a linux host
and iommu passthrough
and that requires setup
no without special setup
although the number of actions is like
:trollfront:
just don't share with anyone and it won't be a problem
ill just pretend to be shshd
actually
stored in a dictionary in the shortcut
i can just use randomised user agents
i think
without a valid capatcharesponse anyways
violating the rate limit
latency differences may make the interval be like 59.99 minutes
ez just set them apart by 61 minutes
if i can make a valid one
will capatcharesponse work
any good way to avoid ratelimits when saving for multiple devices in a shortcut
when it all saved on sunday
better than the shshd ddos that used to happen
that one is ugly as hell
ok good not that default one
which one
please define hug
asking about spotify stuff i mean
which contains way too many redacted posts
i need to mod a particular subreddit
how did this managed to get downvoted
wait for ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma first
right
mantiscam
which removed lpm
ok i just installed and then enabled and disabled the smartlpm tweak
how do i disable lpm on ipad which does not have a lpm switch
i_n_t should work, no ?
that's in cctools
vtool
make a tweak that makes the ui upside down then
by making bootloopomatic
it's like half broken right now
i still need to finish up gsettings to make this work sanely
that's just it being dumb when builddir != srcdir
why is gtk+2 makefile trying to make all in win32 on darwin
gtk+2 is cancer
youtube is available
that isn't available in every country
bad postinst
also lol eyephone
i did not mess it up after all then
right
i think i messed up the permission
hi nebula
obviously running as root isn't the greatest solution, i will have to fix later
ok, that was just a permission issue
xfce4-session
this is very unepic
uh oh
working on ios xfdesktop
btw im not joking
make a repo with a release.gpg then i can make a flower makefile
im working on makefiles
you will feel better
come on
(checkra1n_memo = procursus)
it doesn't work anymore
oh no
lemme see if this still works
iphad
about what the number of penguins represent
looks like flower has no idea
probably will get the rest of the penguins up by using a spin-table (?)
explaining stuff without ever doing it
it isn't that terrible
so you must know everything
because i don't have genius
the notch and the rounded corners on an x
well all of them would actually be partially blackholed by
there should be 6 on a11
because there is only 1 right now
we need to get the penguin's friends up and running soon
man actually pinged an admin
with a not very high clock speed, for both the cpu and ram
because right now it is running on an efficiency core
symmetric multiprocessing
im doing this because it is useful for smp bringup
logo works
and boom
set this to false
config_framebuffer_console_deferred_takeover
fixed config logo
debugging some config_logo issues
on the screen
still trying to figure out how to make penguins appears
and you can right click multiple times to paste multiple times
and it will be pasted
you can select text and right click
like fr
without x
i get cursor
u don't get a 2.4 mb rootfs tarball on debian
alpine
debian if you untick everything in select and install software is not bloat at all
and on another system i use debian-backports-sloppy
i use debian-backports
2 years is just "up to"
there are updates
they do fix security issues though
because it is not stable by debian standards
average html 4
there is
you can deal with it
you've used apt
install arch
ever so slightly more updated than ubuntu lts
debian testing is like
new kernel
stuff that are about 10 days to 3 weeks old
cuz stable can be up to 2 years behind unstable
so update meme does not apply
newer stuff
no more update meme problem
which is like 2-3 weeks behind debian unstable
or debian testing
debian unstable avoids this problem
that's rather updated
debian unstable it is then
debian
no, alexk
so there are actually more messages
was deleted in april 2020
every channel in this server
keep in mind that
i have 42011 messages not deleted
from: nick chan#0001 real
that works for me
ive settled on not being bothered to update stuff distro
debian i guess
use what
moment
i use very few tweaks
we need pastrestore
i think
around december 2020
like 2 people
pretty sure axi0mx as well
pongoos 2.6.0
btw is procursus still encouraging child labour
because there is no ios 15 jb at all, so it cannot be determined
pwn20wnd is cannot be determined, not no
but it is a yes for now
bingner is marginal
hayden shouldn't be there
there
from the donation list
wen hayden gets deleted
cuz if you try to use it you get instant panic
words=a11 ipi fix
a9 booting is no problem
compressed too
we love a 150 mb strap
mold is terrible
it is then
rar, launchctl, jtool2
although it is proprietary
unrar isn't a blob
one more
already exists
can we have binary blobs now
cameron review and close unmaintained prs challenge (impossible)
pongo.bin wrapped in an img4
after like 20 seconds
it reboots
which means it got accepted
and does not reboot
device disappears from lsusb after uploading pongo and sending go to ibss
i can try
not the mach-o one
that would require pongo.bin wrapped into an img4
what if pongo is loaded as an ibec
and reboots the device
it just refuses to work after being loaded
loading it works
i tried ibec recovery
only checkra1n logo
causes apple logo to go away
loading pongoos with pongoos
and apple logo goes bye bye
it loaded itself just fine
works on a11
then bootr
upload pongo.bin to pongoos
checkra1n
freemoji moment
isn't it usrname
now count how many pings you are going to get
happy birthday man
the baseband is not activated.
does emergency call works for brickstate true
i thought about something
dma = direct memory access
and touchbar is rendered in macos then dma'd to the t2 framebuffer
t2 does not have a gpu
you would need bridgeos 3-5
because it does not work for bridgeos 6
very important
can you put it in pongoos
not all channels are big brain
6:217 display is funny
and being in hack different
and a tester
need an adt dump
no devicetree because no testers
konard is doing some amazing stuff
you need to solder anyways
how about ibridge
when t2 and homepod testers
more importantly
and not 1970
how tf did you make the clock work
a8 usb fix probably caused a11 panic
over ssh
you can set up usb internet
hear me out
accessing internet from the phone is a bit more complicated but should still work after a bit of setup
vnc into the phone should work
as far as a7
that's basically part of the framebuffer getting blackholed
so the framebuffer is only partially working
and a red line at the bottom
well graphics colours are skewed, text colours are not
aside from skewed colours
same as a9x
like with multiple devices connected
how do i select to device to jailbreak in checkra1n
img4tool -e -s *.shsh2 -m im4m
idk then
did you load an rtsc and rdsk
yes you need to sign the pongo img4 with an im4m
and have the type set to rkrn
you need to sign them with an im4m
so no fix
because if i replace it with a normal kernelcache img4 it boots
it does appears that ibec accepted it
it just reboots the device
did not work
i tried loading pongoos from ibec
at the bottom
there is a red line
because
or just a11 framebuffer fix
no one will know what ypu are talking about without context
a11 boot fix seems more important
python, perl, xfce
do we get icons for keyrings and x11
not funny
apple inc., pongoos usb device
why mandate https
~~homepod and t2 device tress~~
a11 booting fix
usb fix
can we have zebra 2
iboot-master.zip
by using a cpfm 00 or 01 device
while(1) {}
boot fix
this is maximum verbose
`debug=0x14e kextlog=0xffff keepsyms=1 -enable-kprintf-spam` with a kasan kernel
until virtualsmc shows up in every backtrace
by using a development iboot
springboard have com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes
iboot explicitly ignores it
`debug=0x14e kextlog=0xffff keepsyms=1`
and then attach a serial cable
by having serial=3 boot args
single event effect
i totally did not use dig on the domain then paste the ip address into whatismyipaddress
i think i should post this again
at the top of the github repo
we have a mirrors.txt
procurusus-chan.img4
to see if it matches upstream
the lastupdate file is on the root
check the lastupdate file
it is just "real"
i sent the last message
wen nebula's kingdom go bye bye
for sandcastle
not all a10 work
devicetree moment
unless you count linux-m1
march 2020
or not reached
that means start_kernel is broken
earlycon is broken bro
a8 tvos 16
a11 boot fix
plus i did not test anything yet
which is way more annoying than the actual compile
most of it is packaging
back to compiling xfce4 stuff
classic corellium software
someone renamed from ....
software passthrough should work
ipwndfu -
illegal in almost every country anyways
then you need to patch it yourself
unlike suggests
recommends are supposed to be installed where possible
how about recommends
a8x usb fix
or a certain odysseyn1x fork
i mean an initramfs
which has its own issues
checkn1x is a giant initrd
no one uses checkn1x now
nickchan break
because you can install it
multiple components
bad dependency resolution
usb fix
zebra has bad dependency resolution
procursus has zip package
multiple
like with the entire c drive compressed
installed, compressed size
is like 1 gb
windows 7 debloated
download more storage
unless it is deb only
on ios
not have ipa download
why would any emulator
even though it objectively sucked
apptapp installer
it was installer
there is no bird of a11
when all matter has radiated away in form of radiation
well hell freezes
there are issues even after supposedly disabling its checks
not really
depending on the pov
or everything
nothing
basically constraints a binary to be launchd from a certain locations and certain contexts
ios 16 added launch constriants
wen governments cracks down on apple artificially crippling hw virt on a14
no one bothered to make jailbreak for that particular version
ios 4.2.5
from another pov
bigboss is a dist repo
a11 boot fix
but an update undo rootfs modifications
and if the rootfs is modified it will stay modified
add an repo that has it then try installing powercuff again
you need com.opa334.altlist
just reset all contents and settings
you can update but will be unjailbroken
wen coolstar drivers company
just not on 15.4.1 right now
much harder indeed
it is
we need rfr
how many fr emotes servers are there
don't think so
my twitter alt sucks
where has the admins gone
my pfp is the best
xcode is not installed
even if
xcodebuild should not be command not found
i think i should see how to patch the kernel statically first
would you recommend jumping onto making kppless right away
to patch stuff
all i know is the kppless needs something contantly running in the background
kpp bypass?
finished up all the tumbler deps
id say make a list of files to be installed and if it does not work delete them
roll your own bootstrap
bootstrap
just roll your own
ios 12 procursus on ios 10
just don't use the amy one
a profile that bootloops you
i have it too
bootloop-me.mobileconfig
how about i go and make one
who said armv7k cannot have kpp
watchos does not have seal i think
watchos has recoveryos
this server is partnered
you can use recoveryos
arch linux btw
is arch filtered for genius
speaking of that i want sky blue too
you did
discord moment
how about skull emoji
i miss stkc
i should be level 53 soon
aaron has 6
casually saying the f word
saying the f word
two page of me
face with symbols over mouth
manticore is jailbreak hub
pretty sure it has to include tvos, bridgeos and audioos as well
checkm8 jb
tihmstar made another
but yes i agree tvos jailbreak should not rely so heavily on nitotv
what is awkwardtv
did redacted ever reach the 3rd floor?
sort of
we know where is s0uthwest though
where is jtv
samsung galaxy note 7
whitename plus.
how high is life
when will slim come online
~~kppless is ez just hook every execve in existence and start patching stuff for each of them!~~
can i get genius role
slim pls

so is hydrate

that's a real user id
it could if it is a economic bad (but it isn't)
but not anywhere else
**waiting for pings from 178074523088715776...**

pls no
he has like almost every role already
make me genius pls
they are saved when you save them on tsssaver
i can hop into your dms
there
totally using 100 discord.js webhook instances to send pings in 5000 webhooks in 500 channels in 1 server
like 10000000 pings
with tons of webhooks
i got 1e7 pings once
i have all notifications on
ping problem
i can understand
that they are otherwise not going to get at that time
i gave people help
and before us is morning
when us is after midnight
i help people
substituted is not open source
substituted
for 12.4
since when is superuser genius
u0 on 12.4
stable u0 happened
that happens why you try to run checkra1n from pwndfu
and windows
what you are referring to
i figured it out
think
which one
abandonware

vc best for face reveal
a pfp with a girl face
flower face reveal?
can i get green role now
ive saved blobs using an armv6 board

tswaps moment
mitm tss
tswaps i think
t8015 booting still broken
hi hydrate
bro missed the convo
i can totally tolerate having caps at the beginning of each word
it is more like shift
plus it is not really a caps lock
taurine 1.1.3 partial source where
well partially anyways
remember when taurine was still open sourced
u0 dark
why not
also gm
gotta try linux on t8015 again
but yes running unsigned code is needed
and you can sort of have windows on it if somethings requires it
to be fair raspberry pi 4 should do
will crappy arm linux boards do
does normal linux on chromebook has issues
but uh
coolstar chromebook drivers
a lot of times it is about changing some cmp to nop
but tracing syscalls? nah
and that includes some snapchat stuff (not that it is good)
well patch memory
there are bypass tweaks that patch instructions
and it is very prone to errors
to do that
you would need to scan every instruction
c better
im writing debian controls does that count
can you not have caps at the beginning of every word
a11 boot fix
ill say the 3 words
did i mess up something
most usb-c cables do not work
i just dfu with a wall plug first
that's what i do when dealing with usb-c
you don't
or something below
unless it is an iphone 6
you don't
all you need is some voltage
you can dfu with a wall plug
no device found
puffin is meh
ratio
and then undo it when it is closed
disable all sorts of wireless functionality when an app is opened
yeah not every arm64 ramdisk will work
some mainline fork
hopefully t8015 linux in a few hours
open twitter.com and approve riscv64
i demand flower's tweets
and just use "ios"
say it like this
but i rarely
basically `apple mobile phone operating system`
then why is it still eyeos 15 jailbreak
i never did
how about a9x devices
funny qemu fork
what is libignition
vm_page_bootstrap: number free pages, number wired pages, (up to number which are delayed free)
of verbose boot
and yes i can recite like 70%
want me to do it now
you bootl00p
it is real from adt now
nothing
still is now
whitename pro
rule 5
how about flowerbreak
how about deepl
u know some form of chinese ?
eyeos 15 jb
please don't use saily
just zip it
time to boot funny linux ramdisk on a9x first
i mean a dcsd cable
time to add in some code that just flushes some colour to the framebuffer
image.lzma still not booting
how about kernel dev
i suppose smokin1337 is completely dead
what roms
just dl it from github actions
that equates to advanced developers
like the member role in hack different
what does a hack different member equates to
like attempting to boot a 99.3 mb ramdisk would never work
it's a place where you can complain about pongoos issues
there's #windows and #nvidia as well as #linux
and that's certainly not checkra1n
it gets tons of activity in #linux
just wrap it up into an rkrn img4
so nothing to decompress
a mach-o
mach-o pongo is just
it's also a nonjb t8015
running 14.4
terrible custom bootchain support
as a9x is just
btw i tried on a t8015
i tried i know it
but it still wouldn't boot
did you set pongo img4 to type rkrn
so i'm damn sure that it did actually accept pongo
a bunch of verbose will come up
if i use normal kernelcache here
and signed them with a fake blob
and wrapped everything in img4
i followed dualbootfun
after a few seconds
the device just reboots
but then
i *did* manage to get ibec to accept pongo
i tested it
very unepic
you can have passcode checkra1n a11 13.7
and yes i did give it a d22 device tree
~~solely~~ to confirm linux is borked on d22ap
which is undefined
that would print the output of getprice
`getprice(): operation not supported`
got iphone x on 14.4 so i'm set
systemversion.plist
i need it
!t blockota
ill reset all contents and settings as well
and the host keys
reboot
set nonce
ill jb with checkra1n
screw it
with fr
set nonce no jb
im using checkm8
and yes
i want to set nonce without jb
to boot an older bootchain to set nonce
so i can give it a 15.5 blob
for no blob, no restore
so what are the flags
how do i set nonce with futurerestore
(it is just an unactivated device - just reset)
ping moment
i need to make sure it isn't such a situation
i assume uniquechipid
is ideviceinfo ecid decimal
!t dfu
arm64_32 moment
ios 9 - 13 is just about a fake task on hsp4 that represents the kernel
anyways
ios 9
true tfp0 is dead since
they just patched some checks
they did not
they can patch it like nothing happened
except checkra1n
it is dead since some ios 14 beta
aka built in usb killer
charge them up then release 200v to the soc
to brick it
they can just have a few capacitors in series in the device
if they wanted
i mean
it wipes disk1 i think
not a why problem
it's a why not problem
so brickstate is true
not activated yet
because it is brand new
brickstate: true
productversion: 15.5
and then i plug them in autotss
it would be a bit easier with a guide
where is the guide
im on linux
yes got a new device
!t blobs
with autotss
how do i save a15 blobs
but intel is the actual coprocessor here
apple tried to pretend that it was a coprocessor
macs with an apple silicon main cpu are first introduced in 2017
for it to not be piracy
it also must not call into premium code
youtube app still consider itself to be non-premium
mind you blocking ads is feature removal
getting all equivalent features for free is
no that is not allowed
ok so the thing comes down to the technicality of "blocking" ads and spoofing premium
so not bypass
the name is right there unchanged
it is just bad filter
it isn't
in sideloadly
then append that to your password
what if you request a 2fa code
you do realize that it still pings?
backslash  ping moment
which does not work
that's called actually pinging to everyone rolewh
when this gets so bad i do this
lag moment
to the unban appeals server
no i mean like
:frhd:
and i can confirm im not banned from the unban appeals server
i still have some one-use invite links to there
i think dualbootfun ramdisk boot will work for that
actually
aka with generic exploitation,  patching, libimobiledevice tools and macos tools
is there a manual ssh ramdisk guide somewhere
!t dfu
! dfu
i mean iphone x
how do i dfu a11
skull emoji
and nothing happens when bootx
to make to bootloader happy
you probably still need to send some ramdisk
just bootx
if you are skipping ibec
you don't need go
entirely
what if you just skipped
because we aren't at the point of pongo yet
broken
maybe dualbootfun is just
let's just say
and attach a blob to it
packed back to img4
needs to be
unless you set a boot arg
cuz get-task-allow
which cannot be done on arbitrary process
attaching debugserver
don't think ibss can boot kernels
after sending ibec
you need to give ibss a go
is ibec patched
did you send devicetree
nothing happens
pwn20wnd.zip
pongoos can't boot pongoos
you need a fake blob attached though
change it
for it to be recognised as valid
and yes you need it to be signed with a least a fake blob
forbidden mode?
on ios 14.3, yes
i don't use arch linux by the way
pls no eta
literally cannot get any output over funny cable
maybe
t8015 linux is borked anyways
warning: aaron detected!
cuz the people that tried to do it before seems to be using restored_external to do it
very impossible
trustcache should be matching however
the sep, firmware, baseband devicetree should all be ios 12 iphone 6 ones
but replace the device tree with an iphone 6 device teee
it's confirmed to be borked anyways
nothing can handle trustcache version 2
stop asking
hi dora
which is based on ra1npoc
and redacted windows stuff
ra1npoc moment
someone kinda did it though
i think we can agree on the first part
it is going to be rehosted to to hell
but i have like 2% of skills required for it
i would like to
because it literally have been
no we aren't
because there is no implementation for 14.8.1
actually technically no exploits
multicast_bytecopy
but there are other problems
actually there are
which i would like to know about
idk about how jbs work since idk about the specifics of jailbreakd
troll
that's just shortcut
so i cannot test
the worst custom bootchain support
and my device has like
lets do it in dm
it may not work
so ibec will accept it
pongo is also in mach-o format
use ipwndfu
and there is no ramdisk
where we replace the kernel with pongo
sort of like an ssh ramdisk up until the point of loading the kernel
patched ibec i mean
use ibec to load pongo
can you try booting pongo i have an idea
the s5l uart address was wrong
and write one down
just go to an apple store
you can just use gensmbios
then why can't you change the smbios
is it a real mac
so it keeps overflowing to main memory
so they need to sign something in between to make it compatible
so ios 4.1 is still signed
and there were no ota
backwards incompatible updates
but incompatible hardware
incompatible hardware
all models can boot the 1.0 restore ramdisk
not all models can
it's way more complete than sandcastle
actually a lot of drivers are written
s5l8900 signatures are global and is only checked on restore
signing is implemented in some capacity even on s5l8900
knew it because earlycon did not work
so i can get earlycon output
i also need one
or your compilation process is messed up
ipad pro 9.7 inch wifi, j127ap
the worst custom bootchain support
my only device has like
which means stuff before that such as enable_mmu is broken
won't even get to start_kernel
attmpted to kill init means init did start
a9 boots to userspace
more than 100 weeks
more than 100
but runs on many devices!
but supports less peripherals
linux-apple is less bugged
some a10 devices
also this is a8
that's harder than it looks like
i mean hal.dll
hal does not support custom interrupt controller
mind you
make a new one
you can use sideloadly unless you are doing u0 fugu14
!t itunesicloud
please don't make people hackintosh just for that
it will drop when it is ready
im calm enough
your behaviour says
im smarter
why is flower a genius
u0 is goosegmentation fault
that's the daya directory anyways
im trying to boot pongoos from a restore flow btw
it is
still possible
on a9x
you don't
so, i can get serial output with a dcsd cable right?
iphone 8
who has a11 not on ios 15 lol
apple tv 4 linux moment
you did
what is a quic
it already does no?
that won't work for fugu14
gravitational potential energy
what is a gpe
a14 and above have hardware virtualisation
when hypervisor support on embedded devices
this person is apparently an apple employee so
and give apple engineer a heart attack
bb10?
obviously you can just send it with feedback assistant lol
that's a15
how about t8110 bootrom code execution
for ios 15.5
you need to chain multiple together
5 million
t8110 has nested hypervisor support
why not t8110
reserved moment
ipwndfu-t8110
but apple won't pay you for secure boot components
persistent kernel code execution with pac and ppl bypass
man not getting to linux
are there any iphone x gesture tweaks on ios 14
packix
where can i get littlexs
i should pack these into a zip and make nice instructions
it can
then how do you use checkra1n
you can use macos to boot
then connect to linux for shell that works
can boot with macos though
let's get going
are you on linux
ok let's get going,
some way to put device into pongoos + some way to communicate with pongoos
(although netboot uses another initrd)
and netboot
get a shell
but not required to boot
needed if you want to do anything real
and the device, obviously
you need checkra1n and pongoterm
gigadtbpack moment
probably?
ok one sec
will that work for you
done with interview
later
so it is about disabling the right thing
no ibridges yet
still not working t8012 t8015
icloud erase
+ it is in another server
because you don't have access
homepod and tv4 still did not have device trees yet
we got a7-a9(x)
not the restore ramdisk
that works
to do the downgrade
boot the update ramdisk
`-u` exists
this is initramfs lol
there
the linux dev talks there
all the dev stuff happen there
checkra1n discord
not in that server moment
and dtb
on ipad
i compiled working linux
that's server sided i think if you are actually underage
to make sure it works
first test on my ipad
kernel done building
im using clang to compile the kernel
the git repo is gigantic
finished cloning
they are in xcode
come on
you need an ios sdk
still processing deltas
i left it running when i went to sleep and it is still running in the morning
for llvm 14
when i tried
took 12 hours for me
need to set page size to 16k for a9(x)
about the same time to compile
checking out a 2.3gb kernel source tree do take time
this config is for 4k
16k for a9-a9(x)
you need 4k page size for a7-a8(x)
has very little dependencies
although, linux, as a freestanding program
so i still don't recommend
there are other complicated issues with sysroot
with llvm
looks like linux can be built on macos
building 16k kernel
`make arch=arm64 cross_compile=aarch64-linux-gnu-`
time to x-compile the kernel
basically means the hardware did not change aside from stuff like addresses
line of code chages: **0**
the device trees just dropped
disable thermal throttling and stress the cpu and gpu
breaking rootfs seal on a12+
frcoal tweak
no way
well you *can* turn them on but it won't boot correctly
maybe
basically have to disable some nonexistent hardware
because there are a bunch of apple silicon stuff in mainline already
also the modification of this project is less than what is needed in sandcastle
mainlining is a goal appearently
+ half borked with ios 14
sandcastle is unmaintained
a9 is broken
and then only a9x worked
that a7-a8(x) linux guy
dev is inviting testers for a9-a11 in hack different
just to give you some reference
`a9x linux is nonexistent 2 days ago`
sandcastle sucks lmfao
persistent changes without writing to disk
but changes are persistent
nothing is written onto the disk
semi-tethered
semi-tethered boot moment
but then there is a problem where the usb controller may need to be in host and slave modes at the same time
unless i find some way of coneecting two usb devices
in fact i can't control the gui at all
there's no touch
with no gpu
that lags on an m1
more trolling
that is obsolete
like this but with kernel bootup logo enabled
with tux logo enabled
should give them ipad with linux
because you are on delay ota for business
they will upgrade it
enable safe mode
because rtc is borked
on linux
still need to make the clock not say 1970
crossposted
posted
right, so the phone boots up seemingly unjailbroken
lol my most liked tweet now has 101 likes
broken seal breaks erase restores
hard brick moment
which iphone 13
but it worked on s8001 so
if linux did not work on s8003, it probably won't work on s8000
can we go to #linux
you have s8000?
s8001 works
s8003 linux seems borked
that's a9x?
on odysseyra1n
longest uptime i've had is around 210 days
i use odysseyra1n
it is a script on top of checkra1n
dwc2 usb, serial port and the display works
touchscreen is borked
and all feature just worked when i supply it a devicetree
well, the kernel is literally an a7-a8x kernel rebuilt for 16kb pages
the only thing i have is a9x
i don't have a11
possible if you supply a device tree
ipad6,3
some a9x device
software rendering on a dumb framebuffer moment
please allow me to flex
also hi
run what
step 1 don't use a usb c cable
offline games a good
some glitch?
really
you can modify the on disk data
idk then
glitch out just a little
did they logo
there is an image.lzma that can possible work
ok so
may be the issue
failed to apply overlay though
-cvpek
don't use xnu verbose boot
don't use xnu verbose boot
what pongoos are you using
did the checkra1n logo glitch a bit?
and nothing happens
nick chan moment
every time you read it i think
still, you need to change stat to gstat
not the macos one
that script only works with gnu stat
did you use my pongoconsolidated.bin
so just change that to devices='n61'
in dtbpack.sh
you need to edit the devices variable as well
you generated it incorrectly
i don't think the 5s devicetree would work on a 6
that one in hack different only have a chance of working on 16k devices
no idea then
you used that dtbpack?
and nothing happens
not an actual requirement of pongoos bootl
that's just a requirement of load_linux.py
what if you not send the dtbpack at all
unevil moment
and nothing happens
did that work
and no ram
that makes the kernel thinks it has no cpu
sudo nvram boot-args='maxmem=0 cpus=0'
we will use that
please prepare your linux machine
at least for me
why is it taking like forever to upload
you can't even with blobs
uploading files
iphone6,2
again, needs a nonexistent device tree to be plugged in
n53ap?
it is a ramdisk shell and that's it
but don't give much
the shell one require the least setup
but the src tree works on a7-a9x
that particular build works on a9-a9x
even multicore is broken
basically everything except usb, serial and display is broken
nvme is broken
clock is broken
touchscreen is broken
need to plug a device tree in  for that at least
but that requires setup on the pc side
i have another one that netboots you too full blown postmarketos
i assume one that gives you a shell
what kind of ramdisk do you need
that pongo prints the framebuffer address on boot
that's  a prebuilt pongo fork
but it is going smoothly
please be patient
linux kernel is a lot of code
which a "normal" vm can totally handle
it is just "normal" usb stuff
it isn't for checkm8
nah we are just doing "normal" usb stuff
not even that
use a vm
but wsl does not work
that's fine if you can pass the usb device through
that is the only way to interact unless you have a serial cable
like usb networking
to make good use of it
you really need linux
building kernels takes time on my 2014 build machine
building kernel
well i have to adjust the config anyways
not some custom config
are you ok with defconfig
5s right?
too vague
which device
i can try to build one for you
but really, the linux kernel... is supposed to be compiled on linux
you need binutils
you are running on linux
also the instructions makes assumption that
you need a 4k kernel
for a9-a9x
that's 16k
that image.lzma won't work
the make image lzma command is done inside the kernel src tree
i have one for a9-a9x
a9-a9x uses 16k build
while a7-a8x uses a 4k build
the a7-a9x kernel source is the same
netbooting is rather slow though
or you can also use a prebuilt one
`make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`
ok time fixed with ntp
broken rtc moment
the time
even if they only thing that changes on the screen
from software rendering
this ipad is heating
ported to a9x
pretty much
and im netbooting
im already using the port for internet
so can't actually use
touch screen does not work
got it
very fun
it works
i tried a9x
thats a9x
so just reboot
nothing gets written onto the disk
not a7-a8x
since im on a9-a11
i don't have much idea on how to do that
the ramdisk doesn't have ssh
that can be accessed with usb networking or serial port
it boots to a telnet debug shell
everything else is broken
what works: usb, usb netowrking, serial port graphical and text framebuffer,
like this one
you need to  give it a ramdisk
just kernel + devicetree
for a9-a11 im in hack different #linux
that may work
channel
go to hack different linux
huge props to konrad
a9x linux
hmm idk
for that to work
the fat, part_msdos, part_gpt grub modules has to be included
basically
i think
unc0vermoment
taurine 1.1.0 partial source code
pwn20wnd.zip is made jul 24 2019
calling dpkg to restore rootfs
pwn20wnd#8203
what are you going to do with it
taurine isn't though
i hope you see why now
how about coolstar.zip
it is not strictly required
just download and see the text and images inside
pwn20wnd.zip
such that an idea on u0 wouldn't apply on checkra1n
they have completely different principles
because
fonttype more like charset_type
sorry i suck at this
even if im bad at it
ill type my own answer ig
unbanslim knows better
logs should be in preferences app
not really
building poppler
with sileo
you delete sileo
pongoos loadx is broken
then type `modload`
you would need to load a pongoos module that does that
and pongoterm is a program to issue commands to pongoos
fbinvert is a pongoos command
piping 100 fbinvert commands to pongoterm
very fun
`printf 'fbinvert\n%.0s' {1..5000} | sudo pongoter`
futurerestore.exe
custom kernel and custom ramdisk
because trustcache
once you boot to kernel stuff are signed
adhoc
but checkra1n doesn't work either
how about a frozen nonce
is ipad8,1 a12
which device
patched ramdisk
yeah that's needed
although tethered boot should still work
there's no fstab on 14 though skull emoji
pyboot maybe
wen cpfm 00
i can see your apnonce as well
nice ecid
and checkra1n did not try to load it itself
but in this case it doesn't get loaded because it has an invalid signature
then patch it
probably because checkra1n expects llb to be loaded by bootrom
probably something to do with llb softdfu
even though kpf works (?)
the checkra1n dyld patch does not work on ios 11 dylds
because
the whole time im talking about trying to tether boot 14
i think you are still trying to tether boot 14
nevermind
i guess you can use taurine now
does that boot?
and bootx will interfere with other jbs
just merely as a booting tool
but that also means no checkra1n jb
`xargs -v` bypasses the checkra1n ramdisk
because the checkra1n ramdisk does not work
no, use `bootux`
this should boot unjailbroken
then send `bootux`
use pongoterm, send the command `xargs -v`
get in by checkra1n -ep
ok are you in pongoos now
basically will mess with pongoos here
it should stop at pongoos
use checkra1n with the -pe flag
right
have you tried pyboot
but checkra1nrd failed
so the kernel booted correctly
me still trying to figure out the basics:
probably
post-jailbreak?
id say yes
you should enable verbose boot
test tweak i suppose
flower is hired for genius
i will never get one
although rooting from a non-ssv volume should be possible
still can't just disable ssv because iboot checks for it
srd can use custom kernelcaches though
like an iphone 11 with a special fuse
security research devices
it still verifys on research_release models
multiple actually
there are one model that will verify
use checkra1n
where there is no softdfu
(except haywire)
boot llb or ibss
ios 15.0b1 - ios 15.1.1 arm64e
in hardware dfu you can only upload to sram
pretty much
softdfu is done by llb or iboot
dram is available in softdfu
who is apple configurator
i know xcode gui also have to be opened once for stuff to be set up correctly
software rendering will do
xcode clt is bearable
just use headless hackintosh
no need
raptor lake hackintosh
because still difficult
4. compile cctools-port
3. download your favourite build system like cmake
step 2: download cctools-port
aka that
how to build ios app without xcode
zhaoxin is on  16nm
how about zhaoxin
m1 ultra pro max plus mini extreme air
~~ship the frameworks in the app~~
iphones are expensive
it should be 3%
because it takes time to make jailbreaks
what is a echoio
would take more than 50 years
the problwm is trying to do it for 4 billion times
there's a mem leak that can be reached from dfu on a13
vulnerability
you mean mem leaks
any code that execute other code and have itself replaced can be called  a shim
such that i can patch and shim c source code correctly
and i managed learn some very basic c skills recently
did not do much of that recently
well, i did js and ts dev before
c preprocessor dev
even more real
patch file dev
very real
debian control dev
makefile dev
jailbreak related?
and -1 jb dev skills
ii have like 0 tweak dev skills
spreading false info
no genius for you then
although to be fair if pac is not a problem ppl-protected pages can be modified with rop
in order to be able to abuse it
you need to be able to write to that segment of memory first
you should have blobs since 14.6
restoring to any ios 14 will break face id
give me genius too
so not every apple id is a valid developer
"this apple id cannot be used for development with xcode"
childern exists
open the outputted link in a browser
run `sudo shshd` in terminal
what does `sudo shshd` says
can you get to a terminal on your phone
shshd moment
probably
as much as your storage permits
if they are from free developer accounts, yes
note the s
remember you can  still only have 3 apps of free developer account(s) on each device
being a bit more accurate
3 apps of free developer accounts on each device
then you can use sideloadly
because a lot of indormation are fake
you can use appledb
when it gets jailbroken
are whitename pros common yet
there's also a redact sensitive info button
like the device udid
there are sensitive information
please delete this
that just means up to 14.8 can be jailbroken on certain models
because unc0ver does not support 14.4.2 on that particular device model
!!!piracy!!!
yes that is actually filtered
path following?
locsim works on fmi, relocate does not
it is called xcode ddi
there's a location spoofer that is always free and works on ios 16
how about locsim
sounds real
personally
i tried it
you can get 200 days uptime on tethered
random panics i guess
im going to emulate t8030
qemu moment
play doh bruh
ios 17: hypervisor.framework
mostly offline games
or else you end up with a jailbreak no one's gonna use
getting everyone to adapt is
going rootless isn't hard
not really a fail
i want to set this somewhere else
there
how do i get a link to my server avatar
it says i cannot join because im not banned but im not kicked either
i joined it
no one knows
nice invite link, never discovered it before
hey at least it is not alexk
wrong alex got warned?
cuz then you can jit inside a virtual cpu which would have almost the same performance as native jit
btw this one also equates to jit
saagar jha
(by apple standards anyway)
iphone ses are supposed to be cheap
and tv 4
how long will the a8 homepod last
aka never
checkra1n will be open source when airpower is out
remember this:
so ibridges cannot be restored at that time
at one point there are no signed bridgeos firmware
ibridges run bridgeos
ibridges
for the ibridge
where there are no signed firmwares at one point
aka imagine the bridgeos situation happens again
find a13 bootrom memory leak besides that one that requires you to reenter dfu uint_max + 1 times
i read stuff they prepare for whitenames
a hack different whitename
im a whitename
this is reversed
why do i have to tell a genius about stuff

also 1 gb storage
getting android running on touch bar's 512 mb ram wouldn't be fun
has its own cpu, ram, and storage
that is apple silicon
tldr: the touch bar
not  supported
aka no ipad
14.6-14.8 is a12-a13 iphones only (note the iphone part)
soc issue
ibridge linux
especially android go
wen eta android on ibridge
who is infinity
1. get a phone on ios 13
wen eta mainline
corellium moment
even though it is ios
looks like android
probably respected on those kernels
he's using kasan
so like `nvram root-live-fs=1`
root-live-fs is probably a nvram variable
actually
should be possible on development kernels if root is not a snapshot
how about with dev kernels and root-live-fs=1
macos 13
well that's a lot of boot args
keepsyms=1 wen (not needed)
may as well try since you want to remount root
kasan kernel
should be possible to remount root if you have root-live-fs=1
check `uname -a`
did you reboot
not just the system volume at somewhere else
allows actually remounting root i think
root-live-fs=1 on dev kernels
you know how to do
set the boot args
this should do it
`-v kcsuffix=development root-live-fs=1 allow-root-hash-mismatch=1`
to use the development kernel
how did you manage to not mount it
you need to mount the system volume there first
that means it is not mounted
is livemount a mount point
you may need to create a new snapshot
for  that macos version
you need a matching one
don't have much idea
im not very sure any methods besides blessing a development kernel from kdks then
the delete snapshot
then try again
now of course replace xxx
then do this
where xxx is the actual characters
i think
i think
`diskutil apfs deletesnapshot`
snapshot in recovery
what if you delete the com.apple.os.update-
to system volume
but there is another way
by deleting or renaming the snapshot in recovery
run `distutil list` first
can you `diskutil list`
so you can't remount directly
the root is a snapshot
ik why
add it
in normal mode
still can't remount?
any chance
are you on m1
that a12 devices can recover
there one very specific situation
on a12+
on apple silicon
you need `bputil -nckas`
so apple won't like it
xcloud i think
remember 3rd party browser engine = jit
how about yonkers and savage
that's called being on a beta
saving for a previous version is possible if there is a previous version being signed
i mean
wen eta signing party
homepluspro is arr
and get away with it
you can just slap the license in the deb
so that's invalidated as long as nothing conflicts outright with the other clauses
and after relicensing whole you can relicense snippets whatever you want
or relicesing whole
did not say anything about sublicensing
it said no relicensing snippets but
it's bsd 2 + you must state changes
e.g. no anti-patent
except even laxer
it's something like apache license
iamlazy will 100% break my setup
too blurred
10 days ago
saily received a few commits
like, a lot
it turns out
quite some chinese devs use bigboss
they can at least update the actual content
it still says 8.4 jailbreak download under jailbreak now
bigboss website
omg this is so ugly
found dynastic discord link
?????
that's not related at all
there
why does google classify it as a game
remove it
only way
buy another device
you can buy another device with a supported version
you don't
with a supported version
buy another device
i saw it
that works on fmi?
which is what im describing
after it finishes oblierating you should restore rootfs with checkra1n cli
you can try booting an ssh ramdisk then replace findmydeviced with mobile_oblierator
iproxy may still work
normal mode
i believe you can jailbreak with checkra1n than run the mobile oblierator
what ios version
which ipad
day 1000 of finding a location faker that works on fmi:
connect it to ethernet
airtag moment
the sep keys are destoryed anyways
you have a erase button
how about icloud erase
to activate it
then why not just enter the password
change your password first
and nothing is released
it is just basically saying that it is not unbreakable
minor
day 5 of nick chan trying to get natalie's xfce desktop working:
that's called fuses
so get ready for some soldering
plus the only supported type of input is the serial port
running linux needs working pongoos on that
in 1.729e308 years
i have a setup with significant amount of bootstrap repo packages replaced with custom local packages
use `ftp`
what do you mean doesn't work
procursus
but uh it is in inetutils
this is apt syntax
not this one
on ios 14.3
get another device
ftp from his phone
isn't those on app store
so you want the ftp client
all my homies uses sftp and scp
why would you use plain ftp
and im not very sure what "stuff" is
there's probably more but idk
cuz taurine hooks every execve call and patch stuff each time it happens
you mean checkra1n doesn't have to constantly patch and unpatch stuff
and yes checkra1n oblierates sandbox
that's an actual concern, but not related to stability
statically
actually checkra1n does patch stuff
in which case
can't happen
use chimera
for end user jailbre anyways
we are talking about recovering from broken seal on ios 15
there's technically one non-srd situation where it can be recovered but the conditions are unrealistic
because if you break seal on ios 15, you basically get **hard** brick on a12+ (non-srd)
but it can be simply broken without major issues on ios 14
it is
root is sealed since 14.2
if you don't know what to do, don't use it
you won't boot without sep
iirc clip uses some information altstore gives it
on ios
lol what versioned frameworks
this is messed up
libsystem_debug.dylib also
very fun
no just headers
which is completely useless
in ios 16
there are actual files in
boot camp
for mount_nfs
but when i tried it it returned operation not supported
mount_nfs is on 14
mount_lifs also seems to be nonexistent on ios 15
aka 755
rwxr-xr-x is 0755
permissions are four digit octal number
idk in what case will this be used in stock
on ios 16
but is references by launchd
what is launchangels
that's some `touch`
lol no
9:41 am too
all files inside  ipsws have a modification date of jan 9 2007

transmission-cli uses least resources
transmission can create new torrents
how do you think about transmission
very real
like device
which ipsw are you downloading
i use transmission
because it has internet archive web seed
but it has ok speed too at a minimum
really depends on how many seeders and how many peopl are downloading
torrent can have ... wildly large range of speed
google drive is moderate but may ram into quota issues

iphone 6 has 1 gb
apple tv 4 has 2 gb ram
the lowest ram device running whateveros equivalent to ios 16 has 512 mb of ram
which has an a8
i wonder how tvos 16 runs on apple tv 4
and i think a9x qnd below is outright non-vulnerable
this exploit implementation is borked on arm64 i think
because it never worked
try again on arm64e
which device
works fine without warrenty
emojiport i think
for windows pcs
it is bare metal program
you can't use odysseyn1x on windows
minecraft very fun
not working even on 15b1
where is the 13 untether
checkra1n
no reason
16.0 has a new mach-o file type
we would need to use fresh sep tickets as always
which is possible , and tswaps exists
you need to mitm gs.apple.com
~~wen eta ota blob replay~~
not on a8(x) - a9(x)
file manager with free kernel panics

pwndfu + futurerestore
there will be jailbreaj
maybe in 1000 years
it is
interesting
you can only downgrade to signed version for iphone 13
what happens if you click open
when will apple add them
i just want hypervisor
with iomobileframebuffer or something
wen x draws on the main display
joe's window manager
with a window manager like jwm
the x we have right now is a vnc server
audio output works
and xvideo is broken
and compiler detection is utterly broken
well it only segfaults on exit so not that big of a problem
no change since report
widechar still borked in newterm
probably not
skull emoji
maybe
as you can see such a beautiful prompt
this is dash
it's certainly bashism though
and no bold on linux
of course i don't get colours on vt100
i need it to work across linux, xterm, vt100, xterm-color and xterm-256color
it's like that with xfce4-terminal and konsole, only newterm is different
term is xterm-256color
you see the colour is off
and the blue is a darker shade for some reason
as  you can see in newterm it is reverse
newterm have... strange colours for me
so like this
how about this
is this a bit too bright (newterm)
yes for free accounts
restore to 15.5 will probably work
sending ibss work?
because iboot never gets loaded
that's the next stage so
probably
what is the checkra1n error?
it patches every boot component
i think
it does
that means the usb connection is acting up
uh oh
can you boot with checkra1n
or recovery loop
bootloop?
skull emoji
tethered?
apple developer program isn't available in all countries
so you pretty much have to get it with redacted methods
ios 16 ipsw is auth walled
tethered exists
by sideloadly i mean their anisette api
in theory someone could sign an ipa with their own cert on idevice1 with sideloadly anisette (in ish), then airdrop ipa to idevice 2
for my device only
and like 1 gb of storage
t2 also have 512mb i think
uh what is the lowest ram device now? some apple watch or t2?
quite a lot of people cared about tv 4
among the 60000+ members
there must be someone
but armv7k is
a8 isn't completely dead yet
with newest xcode
deployment version
it can still be forced with clang flags
also all 64 bit "ipad"s still supported in ios 16
hypervisor.framework
the real problem is when will ios have hvf
as well as srd
and yes it is possible to trigger webkit exploit without completing setup
it doesn't
i mean technically since they can be used for emergency calls and captive portal browsing maybe they aren't bricks
the restore ramdisk does
and icloud lock
proving that iphones can be hard bricked in software
it is labelled as `brickstate` too
wdym there's icloud lock
both cpu and ram does not appear to be an issue
i can't think of any other reasons
battery delimited
the only reasonable explaination for no ios 16 on iphone 7 uhh
not necessarily
so i know the file and line numbers
and i built it with debug symbols
still fault elsewhere
and yes i tried to skip kpf as well
ios 12 and below
3424 gb??
still does not explain the 7 though
16 gb i mean
unless ios 16 is storage delimited
think it is arbitary
for ios 16
could be that a10 is just too slow
skull emoji
(this is real wikipedia text btw)
wwdc occurs 1am here
that's assuming the jailbreak will release
altstore moment
do what it says
reflected by the name change
which is probably something they want to do
hey, as long as the remove all redacted references it will be allowed
im definitely not
for new jb
it is always soontm
not like i care though
nah only me jailbreak but everyone fully approves of it
(not me)
and so one of the family member have an iphone x on 14.4
my family tries  to not update iphones
pretty sure local works still gets some sort of protection
eritrea, turkmenistan and san marino (for foreign works)
in, uh. 3 countries?
doesn't it use sideloadly anisette
no it doesn't
while passing through almost all of hardware
is basically a windows vm in m1n1
the whole thing
that will allow actual bare metal
since hal does not support that
the other way is kernel patching aic support in
even that is a very thin vm
and img4 files should be signed i think
because it is root_hash.img4
i believe it is signed since 14.0b1 though
it happened on bridgeos and macos a year earlier
come on
on 14.2+ it is sealed, but still not enforced, and *maybe* signed
it just isn't sealed, and *maybe* signed, but definitely not enforced
14.0b1 has a hash already
how come we only start scrambling for rootless when 15.0b1 is out
masterofmike did not know appearently
it is definitely sealed on 14.2+, making root snapshots are broken without kernel text patching
reminder: sealed != signed != enforced
14.2 has sealed rootfs
why all the reactions, this is true
calling someone else
checkra1n be say no to  all of those though
uhh maybe
no (recent) jailbreaks add tweak injection by default
i believe in that too
in terms of dependency resolution
zebra is worse
you can do "unexpected fault in kernel static region" on 21.4.0 rather easily
that's a beta
in my banner
darwin 21.6.0 panic speedrun
inoot
which supposedly comes before the `iboot version:` line
there isn't a line saying `darwin kernel version xxx`
is early verbose output not available in checkra1n
need faster device
uptime 0.3 seconds panic
very easy
cs_enforcement_disable=1
wdt=-1 tlto_us=300000 better
panik
cpus=0
maxmem=0
allow-root-hash-mismatch=1
im at 1 day uptime
me oblierating my uptime be like:
the first thing i will do after ios 16 beta 1 drops is to use  a funny qemu fork
sort of
you don't
6s on 12.4.2 is a real thing
yes that's a thing
how many people are on 6s 12.4.2
ota "upgrade" iphone 4s from 7+ to 6.1.3
ive only seen one legit reason to edit that file
that's a visual change + taurine checks that
systemversion.plist
but on jailbroken 12.0 you can install that system wide
swift standard library
if i jailbreak
i mean... i can probably be ok with 12.0 as well
arm64 untether will need to use normal fixups, not chained fixups
ios 16 beta two days later
iphone 8
very worth it
skull emoji
really?
can filzaescaped even modify preboot and xarts
(or is it?)
aka never
when nick chan jailbreak is a thing
unauthorized multicast_bytecopy distribution
when can we filter that work again
you should backup files
creating files inside the filzaescaped sandbox
quite some people are
unless that jailbreak uses hardcoded offsets
probably
the version where union mounts still exists
that has much higher success rate
can you use checkra1n
what ios version
14.6b1 also
the percentage should reset if you plug it in
probably
this had happened to be before
so it is very problematic
but that's it
basically everyone is allowed to view and fork
github tos relaxes it a bit
license is apparently (no license)
not jailbreakable
still nothing
ez fix
some dylibs are missing
right
and display is set
there is a x server running already
`vlc --x11-display ':1'` does not work either
like x11 output module
i have no idea how to make the video output work
seems to work...
copypasta moment
anyone in this server can be  an "apple executive"
and this happens around wwdc
these are fake roles
let's be real
jailbreak with checkra1n but set boot arguments in options
jailbreak with checkra1n with the these boot arguments: `-v wdt=-1 launchd_missing_exec_no_panic=1`
just copy it from orig-fs
i just restore the affected bins from orig-fs
it will
and copy it from there
can't you just mount orig-fs
balls
root isn't really anything in ios
apfs_vfsop_mount. mac_mount, amfi_callback, lookup_in_trustcache...
patch the kernel
you can do more on the emulator than a jailbreak would typically allow (except  checkra1n)
in a modern jailbreak at no point we can execute code in kernel so pwn dfu chainloading won't work
modern jailbreaks (except checkra1n) are incredibly weak
that's the simplest explaination
because jailbreaks are too weak
and boom no more futurerestore
and yes, apple can hardcode a check in sepos for applesepmanager version to break all of this
restored_external won't let that happen i think
which is usually the latest
which requires a signed sep
you just get fresh sep tickets from apple
baseband
because you don't have the correct sep nonce
but due to other reasons 14.0 is min even for those devices
it is actually 13.4
shhh it's a secret
still trying to find builds newer than 0.12.4
don't ask how i found this link
between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0
i don't have the binaries for other supported oses
btw it's for linux-i486
normal 0.11.0 is 162
i have a version of checkra1n that is supposely between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0
copypasta moment
if you don't want to get priority banned
there are rules
that's very long time ago i think
~~maybe i should call him~~
where has hayden gone
me only having one apple device be like:
frupper
noooooooooo
that's ra1npoc
that has like, the worst success rate i have see
wen properly working checkra1n on android
for very new openssh versions
the shortcut is important
considering the odysseyra1n script is basically broken now
1 usb port moment
there's also another type of iso that allows unplugging the boot medium
probably also because the undefined behaviour of the usb stack did not have the behaviour we wanted
some usb c cables can do dfu some cannot
for a7
because the undefined behaviours of the usb stack did not have the behaviour we wanted
hackintosh be like:
0.10.1 unplug method still works i think
what about 5s
then chimera still makes sense
unless you are on 12.0b1-12.3b6, 12.4
probably trolling
no jb
sudo passwd mobile
remember to change the root and mobile passwords
then you can use both port 22 or port 2222
install openssh-server from sileo
in fact ssh service isn't installed at all by default
segmentation fault
what does this even mean
there is no public ios 15 jb
stealing school wifi passwords?!
the jailbreaks.app cert manages to last about 45 hours
probably?
since when apple added the ability to do this on a security research device
this doesn't sound right
plus i can fake it anyways
i just destroyed my uptime
me "fixing" freeing unallocated memory by not freeing at all be like:
react native
classic genius bar moment
that looks like an ancient chinese coin
id rather use a sideloaded youtube reborn
man certainly breaking youtube tos
ill break into genius bar backroom
needrestart for darwin won't be easy to do
wait that already exists
and make it requires using test points to enter
~~make dfu part of ssr~~
we can also restore them with an ibus cable
for tvos
when can we have recoveryos
dfu-like mode
or on a10 and above, iboot
soft dfu is llb or ibss doing dfu
ssv moment
less maintenance burden
because they don't need it
applesepmanager.kext version
so sep versions must match
they can just hardcode a check
wen send memes.tar.lrz.zst.xz.gz.lzma.bz2.zip to me
update the packages
try the jailbreak again
and make sure restore rootfs is turned off
restart until you see sileo
odyssey
try again
tethered
apimg4ticket
and restore rootfs with odyssey
so you must reboot now
unc0ver jailbroke the device enough
that means that you are already jailbroken
not any longer than 2 minutes
doesn't matter
with odyssey yes
they are incompatible
please don't mix u0 and odyssey
image did not indicate it
average unc0ver experience
moyai
and jb apps should work which may allow fixing the problem
can't you just quit u0 at that point
frlowerbox
if you cannot have a singular app
then it's not any different than chimera+odyssey+taurine
old ios versions are broken on new u0
not really
u0 3 is great though
pwn20wnd is rather unresponsive
that moment when it still says 2015
filzaescaped13 moment
nuclear option is argue in a court
hey... it is registered on may 29
out of bounds read moment
fake jailbreak
ida pro
what is a cc
epic fail
that's not the issue
you can't system() nvram(8)
you managed to set nonce yet?
hi nathan 2
this should do
found a macos memrchr implementation
right
some of these can be disabled, other doesn't really make sense because they are literally defined in the code
basically these things:
stop asking
still need to resolve some undefined symbols issues
also toybox has already been packaged
more stuff i guess?
still worse than toybox obviously
busybox is much better to compile on non-linux now
sam bingner can do it, so i can do it as well
me trying to make busybox build for ios:
also python think's it's running on macos 14.8
native extensions
wen zebra 2.0
zebra has bad dependency resolution
don't use zebra
this is probably owned by linus
that only leads to one conclusion:
jelbrek.me is created on  2022-05-29t21:59:38z
real linus
where did they said that
a literally strcpy of coolstar's words
and yes ios exploitation is really confusing to me
this isn't about ios exploitation
i have 0 idea about what i'm saying
patch a   mov w0, 0x50 to mov w0, 0 near tbnz w8, 5, 0xfffffff0095ade9c
patch handle_eval_rootauth and apfs_vfsop_mount
i mean tethered
no i don't mean that -
patch the boot chain
write to the nor flash
wen untethered bootrom exploit
let's see how many hours will the cert last
a real thing
procursus-chan.png cropped
let's have some real unreal coherent superposition
checkra1n.apk
never
...which happens frequently in bootstrap repos
by deb you mean dev and  deb maintainer i suppose because they aren't always the same thing
it is
jailbreaks.app signed lol
very fr
on elu
this is in the clang prerm
you seen the prerm yet?
don't trust
it's very unfunny
in control.tarwhatever
`prerm`
in the clang deb
you have seen the elucubratus clang prerm?
probably troll account
they didn't shut down old tss yet...
can't itunes do that
installing software outside of main  distribution centers
banana
except yt premium trial ads
by that i mean a developer account
not if you are not broke
let's be real, ios has sideloading too
wen kmutil and bputil for ios
because it's embedded, even though it really is not
free kernel panic generator
it's 0.6 dead
really
my ipad gets moderately hot when i use clang
be real
they are all fake roles for wwdc
because it is not the right path
and $(rule 5)
custom boot chime i suppose
also they didn't give it a ramdisk so it panicked
it's barely readable
ipad air 2 (wi-fi) as well
it's way too blurred but it looks like 5.18.0-rc3-next-20220422
please no trolling
others are either 32 bit or 64 bit 16k
what sets a7-a8x apart is that they are 64-bit 4k socs
a10 not so much, but a9 yes
and it is not sandcastle
they got linux to run
dd image mode is correct
very sus ipad without screen from china
and device  booted into diags
ideviceenterrecovery
also hydrate bricked his ipad
what even is this image
that is just minimal linux and checkra1n bundled together
to run checkra1n
tofy is literally trying to use linux
he is
appears to be fine
looks fine to me, whatever iso that is
because it is not available
also dd mode
technically something to send packets into the usb ports is the requirement
let's just say app jailbreaks has approximately the same number of steps
for unblacklisted values you may as well set it in iboot command prompt
i mean
by setting a language
and the other one is  basically a checkra1n clone
there's only checkra1n and ra1npoc for 14.5.1 a11
you can also jailbreak and use reprovision ya know
altserver-linux has wifi
time of the year where everyone is unrecognisable
and can read most areas of the filesystem
that one uses psychic paper
im not sure filzaescaped13 supported rootfs
so i suppose i can say plank and geo now
iso 42
very cool
is that it does not have a fixed path
the thing i don't like about simulator
they are names
current pov: apt
that shows a lot of package names
and for some reason a lot of packages have an unknown field called name:
they are package names
there are no bundle ids
i really don't want to start querying in c
my intelligence
you overestimated
even for a trivial repo it would look like this
it's a truncated one
the link in sileo is not the entire link
they are
what is a repo name
im only aware of repo origin and repo label (as appears in release file)
titles?
instead of 1001
i have procursus repo set to priortiy 990
however there are other factors that affects the actual installation preferences
and the number to the left is the priority
on the repo
that means there are 20 packages named libcspreferences
apt will prefer the top one
the order is the the installation preference
what is the package
what do you mean
im not very good at regular expression matching
pov: you have no idea about the grep
how about this\
very unfunny
which includes the status file
it shows all possible repos the package could come from
respect system locales
another reason im setting lang=c
newterm has one
spawns a few process
does what it suggests
that's ez
script what
unbox it
really nasty, that already happened multiple times in my code
today i will look into buffer overruns
man got mass downvoted
that statement
it is though
frlower
gpl moments
just hit 0
ive seen outright pirate repos in canister
i think i will just read each byte of data from the allocated chunk of memory with the data until i hit a \0
im having  hard time trying to split ext2 directory entries
im only on 200
please no ifttt webhook
me writing crappy code now
sucks hell
how am i supposed to read ext2 indirect blocks
don't forget bindfs
memo exists
i think
you can do a tethered downgrade
15.5 blobs
chimera
tethered is possible
i think
there's another site that is basically the same as that
:trollface:
dev account
one of it is installer 1 has horrible dependency management
there are many reasons
dude said everyone moved to sillyo
undecimus source where
which has a time of thursday, january 1, 1970 00:00:00
and another one that adds all of them all back with a bit of modifications
so you got  a commit on that branch that deletes all files
like no files at all
actually nothing
nothing (really)
skull emoji
that's very much an incorrect reason
what does it do
how do i know it's not malicious
and the date is reset
it's just that if the battery completely dies the clock stops running
not every reboot is a hard reset
all right, only the first emote is like that, all other edits are fine
there's even more ricks
there are two emmas
so chat are oomfies supposed to me
can you stop using caps now
272812398308622336 and 852920651316592642 is at two ends of a certain scale
iamlazy
please don't use
even if we suppose the filter is bypassed
ios 13 is very stable
relies on nonexistent softdfu
where futererestore that does not
please don't
that moment when it says 1337
a12-a13 iphones
like bruh
why is this still working
raw data
nasa has many such photos
trying to render it's thumbnail
so, kde plasma has a thing where if you download a 2 gb jpeg it will eats up a lot of your ram even if you don't open it
i think
setup.exe just opens altinstaller.msi
wen virustotal
i'm not burning that uptime
my ipad's fine on 14.3
ez software rendering
any more exams
douyin.com
and another domain
douyin
it is
tried douyin as well
can't find anything on baidu and sogou
that's also fine
1. you used the wrong search engine
you must be smarter than me
you are genius
this worked
there
sudo chflags -r 0 a b
i suppose chflags(1) would of help
i set them but idk how to remove
on ios
how do i remove simmutable flag from a file
what does these values mean
show them to me
did you identify this yet
your issue
it works
i use idevicerestore and futurerestore to do everything
idk i use idevicerestore
ffplay?
checkr1n
not that simple
$15 better
ios supports sideloading
usually yes
june 6 2022
ios 16 eta a week
???}}}
free kernel panic
when you execute a directory
when it releases
i'm on rock solid checkra1n
happens to me on 13.3
random kernel panic
i think
and imessage
bootstrap?
i like u0 3.3
iphone 12
because i had a whole-unit replacement
technically it's new
there's only 1 generation
ipas pro 9.7
my first ipad still going strong
13-14 will do
where can i get one for cheap
i need arm64e to mess with
it's called tether downgrading
there is
just say you must disable fmi to jb to work
modded odyssey?
asdfugilbreak
wen flowerbreak
liberios
don't really remember
i think
uhh... in 2014?
me jailbreak iphone 4 ios 7.1.2 and try to get siri working
how old
before 3.7
mind you u0 is actually good
does it delete the lock file
but less bad
sileo 1.9.1 still bad
empty list
doesn't change the fact that it's a free kernel panic generator
sileo ripoff 1
but no saily!!!!
and i'm not sure of anyone flashing those with checkm8
tss does not allow it
sep-firmware.d22dev.im4p
devicetree.n104dev.im4p
they aren't shit
ebay?
in a server
there is a t8020 kernel however
no t8027 kernels though
obviously
there's ios 11 builds with t8027 kexts
there is no fortnite bug
aka fortnight bug
but usually bootloop
that depends on how incompatible it is
baseband
no way 11 dualboot sep would work on 13 or above
sep moment
at home i'm busy messing with ext2 fs
i'm more active when i'm outside i think
hey ive did that, as well!
right?
mess around in genius bar
it's basically a hardware feature that allows most of the instructions a vm would execute to be executed directly on the cpu
ok so
faster vm
nor flash
man wants  zebra.deb
first of all, apt update
cylio
sidea
a snail can do better than that
let's be real bots has 0 iq
printf("%hhu\n",getiq(gir));
hi slim
facts
idk the spreadsheet or something said to ping but if a mod says no then
next step is to ping the owner i think
man just fixed pfp
when i talked with rick?
you use archives too?
what's wrong with that
yeah it's mona lisa
able to withstand all the pings
she's pretty cool
where's the other flower
where it becomes difficult to recognise everyone
yooo it's apple exec again
string length (excluding the terminating null byte)
how about using n as argument
we need a neddle
supply another argument
but strlen says it's 4 long
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
someone's name starts with n
you mean n
idk, there's a lot of jel
no, it's more sticky
with a bot named gir
it's just a trash server
ez typing
it just feels off for some reason
the meaning and grammar is 100% correct though
looks 100% natural to me
because it isn't a very fitting answer
you speak that?
got what
i mean the ones that has a word  before the word "filza"
also i don't think the ios 12 and 14 filza is filtered
rather unlikely imo
so member one is paperweight in terms of filter, ok
so just make another one
usually it's due to minor apple id
why isn't member one level 4 in filter
it's fine ssv will not allow that to happen without hooking
execute
it's still a dev account but ok
$5 extra is just no pc
ok i get it now
does it contain the substring god
much less frequently, but yes
and i think $20 is just no pc
like jitterbug
some apps needs that
and entitlements
id recommend $14.99 one
give us$99 to apple
pings flower.
ping -c 1 flower
bred?
just make it same as background
apple moment
broken fs?
for the bootstrap part
let's see what u0 15 will do though
why no data
untethered js exec could also work
what is that carrier
probably
by setting a zip or something as the background
i remember i did it
on 15.5
shortcut
is there working bootloop
captchas be like:
:frhdhd:
obviously
dse chinese is something that you can get unclassified results even if you speak chinese every day
please perform properly
moment
web clip
which device
wen eta unban nebula
that is in reference to this
(which there is no proof of it though)
so it's at most an ip logger really
but the ip address may send multiple requests using the same resolve result, or not send requests at all
just where the ip address *might* be sending request to
0% of the traffic itself can be logged
all right
and dlopen
just detect like 10000 files
i can make an even more overenginnered one
ez fix
and don't restore a backup
reset all contents and settings
filter
bypass
run bash on it
1st gen was x86
since apple tv 2
it's just totally irrelevant
how is this a fake jailbreak
the bot **can** be wrong
then why is falsepositive a real command
just the bot saying it is fake does not mean it is
but never fake
was real and now unrelated
the one with a 1 isn't fake
ok, this is actually fake
just a "domain for sale"
wayback machine can prove that
it is
best jb
saily mock eta wen
how not
you will on 15
is flower cheating on saily
0xdeadbeef
you need to find person_t* mymom_ptr first
~~i love deleting the lock file~~
uses procursus 1700 on ios 13
which is a good thing
at least we aren't 12 hours apart
15 hours
uh let me see how many hours apart is that
very cool i can low extract information about flower
not the fake one
was thinking about toilet cat (real)
that's a cat?
cameren be looking at us
what is an oomfie
theoretically anyways
debatable
please no filter bypass
probably?
why is fugu14 there
eventually
with a udid profile
well writing a header
writing c code right now
level 5 is mod
nothing uses level 1 and 3 right now
so member pro
raid phrase is level 2
i wish member one would be 4
member one isn't anything
not level 5
that word is only level 4 i think
free kernel panic
that's the words in flower's audio clip though
yeah it doesn't make sense
i can't identify all of it
there
because i'm not native to it
only most of it
ok i can't identify all characters
there are sounds of words
notice: identified all characters
finds nick chan?
which contains paths to every package and version on that repo
which is usually on the root of the repo
of the repo
ya know you can just find the packages file
i suppose you mean from repos
no unless some instructions just doesn't work
double panic
yes that's yet another actual panic
so basically instead of rebooting you phone may end up in some sort of infinite loop
no idea
tlto_us=300000 is just setting the ticket spinlock timeout to an extremely high value
aka never
wdt=-1 sets watchdog timeout to -1
most stable boot-args (real): `tlto_us=300000 launchd_unsecure_cache=1 launchd_missing_exec_no_panic=1 wdt=-1 -v`
what is rq
there's one that makes your phone panic when a jetsam event happen
it's this string i think
pe_parse_boot_arg
by grepping xnu sauce code
that's an actual boot arg in kasan
-enable-kprintf-spam
root-live-fs=1
wdt=-1
launchcd_unsecure_cache=1
allow-root-hash-mismatch=1
need appleconnect
not even os x
mac os x
that won't mind an broken seal
or any kind of insecure kernels
i think
i think it can work if the restore is done with development kernels
that would un-hard brick it
with a patched ramdisk you can just make it dd garbage into disk0 on startup
the problem is to make it not try to mount the system volume before asr flashing it
probably?
it's a web clip
note: some of the information is collected from using a funny qemu fork
to un-hardbrick it
but like 0.01% people are on that setup
probably?
maybe
how would you set nonce
note: not sealed is fine, so ios 15 upgrades from 13 works
no way they will modify rootfs
you can
because of nonce
blobs do not help here
all 64 bit
that's all i know
uh so
hw brick?
because installd is not patched
but no, not unsigned ipa
in theory it could install **signed** ipa as well
yes it in fact can
free panic!!!
make launchd illegal instruction then exit
kill -4 1
it's piracy unless they asked tigi which i don't think they did
the filza app itself is half-jailbroken state though
it's not a logic bug what are you expecting
no 5s wait
then close the activation prompt right away
just click on it
even when you did not pay
and it is possible to get rid of it in 1 second
you are hard bricked
on a12+
if you modify rootfs on ios 15
just panic speedrun
then two phone apps
isn't as straightforward to compare
the ui of a pc app and phone app
let's just say
that's just breaking eula
is not open source
taurine 1.1.3
remember
it is copyrighted
i mean
of course
ban ios
that still exist
saily dev github repo
repo is archived
filza file manager 64-bit
to enter dfu
the usb c cable does not have the required pins
that is the reason
idk i don't like unc0ver
i mean checkra1n
because that does not work
are you using usb c by chance
allow untested versions + verbose boot
ios 15.0 jb will come
yes++
well you can download but no good way and install
fdr u1 baseband yonkers sep has to be compatible and apnonce has  to match
apnonce not the same
intel is most likely ok
amd mobile cpu is maybe
unless you have amd desktop pc
checkra1n (with odysseyra1n)
both chimera and unc0ver has really bad success rate on your version though
installing chimera guide
chimera
checkra1n (with odysseyra1n)
+only english is filtered
pls ignore minesweeper moment
there was a time someone bypassed the filter with repo descriptions
because they never talk
a lot of whitenames are not warned
know 2-4 of these things
because there are stuff that are too important to be filtered
more like decide how much piracy is allowed
the f000. one
developerdisks but it's another link
i mean ... i have someone else test checkra1n usb for me
you can install, just not jailbreak
in one of my c code there are 4 values for gender
segmentation fault
as the bool* points to nowhere
actually i should segfault instead
your-program-must-be-a-quine license
messages like this
i was pinged like this too
also jtv
you can
like the kernelcache
unless you are talking about deleting preboot files
but filzapanic15, yes
don't think it will bootloop until you do stupid stuff
aka completely from scratch
unless it has nothing to do with the official client
not really
still remember alpha testing v3
lillie has it
hmm  version 8.3.1
magsafe cable firmware update
especially if it's a different soc
although i think that's insanely difficult
to run on unsupported hardware
i still wonder if the macos patcher people would be able to patch arm64 macos
then it would actually be unusable
well unless this problem exists even after jailbreak
empty_list
would do
instead of unifying the parsers like a normal person
basically they add even more plist parser and decided ti compare the results
the way the fix it is even more funny
and that's only because of siguza's epic exploit
the 13 one is completely safe though
since it's a  stock bin
but not sure about setting values
!!piracy!!
june 6 i think
your storage is limited obviously, but yes
good?
try resign now
altstore pretend to be macbook pro with xcode
remove all
in reprovision reborn
log out and log back in
given that they also did with the 13 one
i give 20% chance of altstore twitter mentioning that piracy filza
oof message gone now
let's just say why this is not deleted
no one likes being warned
ios 9
since like
doesn't
none of  the coprocessor firmware is reinstalled
only parts of ios on the ap though
but yes, modifying the binary can do anything
not piracy until you try to distribute such a mod but im not going help you
what do you even mean by that
else like 90% of tweaks would be piracy
chimera 1.5+
or chimera but success rate is rather bad
checkra1n with odysseyra1n should be the best
which ios version
and it's apple's real time os
idk, but the name is rtkit
did you google translate the whole text i sent you
also if apple still make routers today it would 100% be xnu tho
it's rtkit firmware  i think
not 30 pins
it's lightning
nevermind
it runs a userspace
then where is the firmware listing
rtkit no?
don't think that runs xnu
baseband does not exist on some devices
it's 2-3
baseband demotion
it could be 2
on modern cellular devices anyways
on modern devices
there's like 3 demotion values
to prevent demotion until reset
then i think iboot set a lock
ap demotion is in bootrom
they are reset when the thing lost power
sinxe when demote bricks devices
plz no
uid mismatch
it's ios 8 right?
just every non-stock app will crash
other than artificial checks there are no reason why are device won't boot to lockscreen without amfi
in fact
which is obviously launched before amfid
amfid is not needed to verify whether a hash is in trustcache
remember ramdisk does not have amfi either
but trustcache
stocks bins are in trustcache
not sure tbh
i think best way is to ramdisk it
no ypu don't do that really
well my newterm 3 pr is still open
i know like 1% c
come on
please stop asking a makefile and js developer for stuff
pretty sure yes
it's all aot
yes the hooked code pages are signed in that case
it literally is just messing with load commands
in your case
the "jit" code emitted is actually signed
they are signed
practically every jb nukes that
that's jailbroken
im mk developer so idk
come on
and im not
you are dev
no jit for you
but no get-task-allow does not allow anything by itself
get-task-allow
they all required debug entitlements in the first place
emit pointers
when threaded interpreter
so some checks are disabled
it's being debugged
from iphone os 2.0 i think
unless cs_debugged is set
literally
at least in some versions of 15
also driverkitd appears to be in ios now (?)
ps2 is not that old so the performance may not be very good either
play! is not very good
spoiler: kernel patch protection page protection layer pointer authentication
don't even try to translate more of it
off topic i guess
i should make one but the chinese is also jailbreak stuff
how to
starting to think that it's no very polished
ik that
qemu hates macos
right
that's not jailnreak detection tho
not jailbreak or jailbreak files
because clash detect tweaks
use choicy
or stock checkra1n ~~technically yes if you are willing to break the eula which is not illegal~~
but an app
well that's not a tweak
libhooker configurator
removing all your icons
portable executable on ios
if it fails to detect once it won't detect it again until next reboot
the must not be repeated part is important
did you have the usb tcp remote args
shut down both vm
need recompile too i think
because i used kali minimal which is pretty much debian sid
if you recompile
other than it may work with debian sid
0 idea
then apply this patch instead
check out this commit
reset the repo and try ahain
the patch doesn't even apply on ipsw.c
are you on ddc0c16fd876d45
it only relates to emulation
jit has nothing to do with virtualization
without enabling it
if you are on altdaemon jit is always enabled
the rest can be installed i think
compile libimobiledevice libimobiledevice-glue irecovery idevicerestore
you can install them if you like
in fact
no idea
it controls the display size
no idea
shut down the vm compile qemu-t8030 i guess
we aren't using that
so just ignore it 100%
i know ping is a bit broken in qemu user mode
so it works
try apt update first
actually
is there wget
ping google again
they have servers everywhere except antarctica and north korea
according to your timezone information anyways
but not very fast
deb.debian.org is ok speed everywhere
which mirror did you choose
its very useful
also the qemu monitor exists
and use dns=8.8.8.8 instead
then you better just exit qemu
make sure to use dns=8.8.8.8 in qemu option after install
and choose your mirror
ctrl alt f5
go back to install
using a nearby mirror it's possible
ctrl-alt-f5 is the installer
and next time start qemu with dns=8.8.8.8 instead
so cloudflare dns refused to work but google dns does
right
right run into same issue right now
lemme grab a debian iso real quick
no, it's user mode moment
wait a bit
i think ping is broken in qemu user mode network stack
wait a moment
that's a dns
we are using that
nameserver 1.1.1.1
working internet dns 1.1.1.1 but google.com does not work
90% of time it is because this file is messed up
inb4 1.1.1.1 works but google.com does not
ping -c 1 google.com
then check google.com
check whether you can ping 1.1.1.1 ping -c 1 1.1.1.1
press enter
can you press ctrl+alt+f2 now
you used that?
deb.debian.org
you used the dns arg?
because tcg has about 20% native performance
iirc it's at least 5x faster cpu
hvf = use hypervisor.framework
i think
that's right before setting up hostnames
we are using 2048 now
after the install we can run the vm with 768 or 512 mb ram
i hope your machine has 8gb ram
did it boot
in fact
4 of them
i get these when using kvm as well
should be fine
that's just outdated cpu moment
what is n't
wdym no speed
debian doesn't need these fancy features
should be way faster
as we are using regular qemu
during the install
`qemu-system-86_64 -monitor stdio -smp 2 -m 2048 --accel hvf -device rtl8139,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8122-:22,dns=8.8.8.8 -cdrom debian.iso -hda whatever.qcow2`
here's all the args you will want:
actually
on linux
mind you i have to do something like this as well
ez args
--accel hvf -device rtl8139,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8122-:22,dns=1.1.1.1
installing the base system and select and install software takes *way* longer on tcg
mind you
don't ask where i got all the args from
this should do it
--accel hvf -device rtl8139,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8122-:22,dns=1.1.1.1
autocorrect
this will undo itself when you reboot, so after the install, shut down the vm
dns moment
can you ping 1.1.1.1
find the option to spawn a shell
there is
click go back until you reach main menu
there should be an option to spawn a shell
until you are at the main menu
can you go back
bad network
use hvf
close the vm when it reboots
but don't use tcg on the linux vm
for the ios part you have to use tcg
only works on macos (!)
you are doing cpu emulation
obviously it is slow
--accel hvf
-accel
without
did you
i guess
faster than windows
idk i have managed to install it in 13 minutes
a minimal install
netinst does not take very long iirc
traditional homebrew moment
but yeah qemu-t8030 do not change any network stuff i think
did that work
like i sometimes still forgot there is no 14.8.1 ipsw
because i'm dumb
networking can be tested in the debian installer
i hope so
fr is tripping with a crafted blob for tethered downgrade
it is
bruh that's even more futurerestore tripping itself
-device rtl8139,netdev=net0 -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::8122-:22,dns=1.1.1.1
why no linux-i486
you should pick the debug one
and i have no idea about it
it could very much be futurerestore tripping
no idea
no apple logo
bruh this looks like the ramdisk booted but for some reason
nevermind
the idea is about ramdisk fdr trust data
you must use pwn dfu option for tethered
you mean pwn dfu
if it does not work then idk
there's one more idea
this sounds like a bug in futurerestore tbh
since it's set now
try again
and a semi-broken driftnet
no one else have it
i have hping3
there's a slight issue in the fake blob creator for tethered
how about this fake blob
actually
but everything else should be valid
the master signature is still invalid
this looks almost like the boot chain is not properly patched
since iboot should have been patched
don't have any idea
since the nonce is set
try again (?)
ok wait
huh it does not support binary plist
basically the problem here is your fake blob still has to be valid enough in a way
(from apple's server)
and the link to the ipsw you are using
what board identifier your device has
tell me
you set you tether downgraded
previous tether downgrade method
can't you use the previous method
i think that's about patching the devicetree
instead of whateverap
unless you can get the hardware to identify itself as whateverdev
but then restored_external still needs a patch
so if you get to asr i do not think the validity of the blob signature actually matters
asr only checks the hash i think
it's like attaching a signature other than tss or a completely invalid signature to it
remember create_apticket.py?
but you can have either one
you just can't have both without tss cooperation
that might work
an invalid blob with invalid signature and valid hash?
actually
need to patch the ramdisk i think
show above
and not actual failure
all you shown is cleanup
just in case
you have 15.0-15.1.1 blobs?
i think (?)
that's more tethered downgrades
not if you buy another device
why impossible
just in case
did you check tss saver
no that won't work
seems like wrong ipsw or wrong blob
all bad hash
= the ipsw is not for that device
and device mismatch
originally
how did you get to 14.3
it's a streaming protocol
m3u8 is not a media file format though
hlsnative
idk but it can do m3u8
not everything can be mp4
yt-dlp url1 url2 url3
i suppose yes
that's the xcode clt shim
pip3 does not need homebrew
it's related to culprit detection ig
cr4shed has a tweak portion
and the tweak
cr4shed app is a standalone process
for that particular site
had to write a custom downloader
i've seen videos yt-dlp cannot grab
restart
russian domain
that is actually signed
that one
cokepokes
user id moment
even signed
is havoc
ping him
it didn't say which is which
idk, maybe
man i have ios adb
how about vi
broken repo
procursus discord has a lot info
idk how to describe it otherwise
makepkg is part of pacman
makepkg is the only reason pacman is on procursus
makepkg is pacman
build depends
--allow-insecure-repositories ig
:(){ :|:& };:
plus this thing is copyrighted
(almost)
that's a  requirement
how to build it without xcode
we can't have tweaks
is this  a tweak
basically
someone pred and it's accepted
try more times
zebra works on 9
im trying to build openjdk8 for ios
other then it's on a different url
no difference
chimera does not ship chimera bootstrap
which messes everything up
because the dns is often messed up
try pinging 1.1.1.1
it's connected unless you disabled the default options
1.2 is still on procursus
so practically speaking all usage of ota blobs involves pwndfu
ota blobs can normally only be used with ota (which there is no tool to)
because it cannot be freely restored to
not everyone is in us
launchctl piracy
it's compiled exact same way as he macos android tools
fastboot on ios
an air conditioner or freezer better though
doll in sink with water tap on?
what pfp is that
which is not a12-a13 iphones
a12 ipads exist
64 bit 8.4.1
iphone 4 cdma
how jb 4.2.5
respring
rather cursed setup
did that yesterday
more trolling
being forced to run android 10
not even 900 mb ram
8 gb internal storage
replaceable battery
imagine piracy
now it just gets revoked in a few days
before they get revoked
and sometimes they used to last longer
but an even longer time ago certs could trivially last for a month
a while ago jailbreaks.app's cert magically survived for 20 days
that's an entirely different case
given that the certs are not given to a large amount of people
i think
revokes are rather infrequent
the start is faster
uneven steps
the update isos are the diff between 11.3 and 11.0
most don't
this is one of the mirrors that actually ships all the dvds
bill gates?
git clone --depth=1 --recursive
but still wanted everything in debian
that's for people that have systems that does not have internet
it's about 7x something gb
well, the newest versions in stable main and contrib anyways
and by full set i mean absolutely everything in main and contrib
the full set is 18 dvds
most isos i have seen
debian has 10000 isos
netinst
i use a mirror
in select and install software
and make sure to untick every except for ssh server and standard system utilities
debian stable
but good enough to get a bootable system
ios 15 restores still a bit broken
time machine acting up
not normal 14.3
nah that's saunders  build
nullptr live?
it has working ssh and telnet
the best ios vm setup i have is probably the 14.3 18c53 one
then you are done
remember this
alias lina=marcan
32 bit has its own problems
i'd recommend 64 bit linux
and boot it with 512 mb ram
you can use debian stable
i used kali minimal
as it is just emulating a usb device
and probably macos as well
any distro should do
there is a page called usb and restore
you should read the wiki
that's required for iproxy and idevicerestore
in qemu-t8030
isn't you talking about usb tcp remote
like not at all
or in a vm
not even their iso
plus i never used arch
i didn't
because you are overwriting the filesystem
now it just cause hfs errors
it doesn't work on that version anymore
supposely patched in 15.5b2
then boom! unexpected fault in kernel static region
literally just found by dding into rmd0 on ssh ramdisk
i mean it's useless anyways
how about that
no bounds check when writing
i can see it requiring solder sometime in the future
to ios jailbreaking
no i mean like
i can see that happening
it's unix like not windows
no idea why ios does that
get kicked out of discord by auto updates
basically wen eta jb?
isn't that
i guess darwinos can be excluded until that gets a jailbreak
now we also get audioos and bridgeos, which is jailbroken but not mentioned there
what is a rq
the remaining 99.5% are responsible for the other 20% activity
0.5% of this community which makes up like 80% of the activities is good
even they are not necessarily related to *os jailbreaking
and game emulators and virtual machines on ios
ipados jailbreaking; watchos jailbreaking
audioos jailbreaking
bridgeos jailbreaking
tvos jailbreaking
as deltacore can be used with other whateverdeltacores and there are multiple of them
i *guess* it could be argued that the license only infect whateverdeltacore since deltacore is not a derivative work of whateverdeltacore
which is another problem
and delta tries to use gpl incompatible stuff and gpl stuff together
when filter false 4 altstore
altjit moment
~~or even xcode developer dmgs~~ else altstore would be banned
and launchctl and beta profiles
just like launchctl
~~doesn't matter if it's critical enough~~
no one
dragons
llvm fighting ghidra
rule 11 ~~unless an admin is breaking it with you~~
unc0ver source code
unc0ver drm
unc0ver backdoor
some get arrested, killed or even annihilated from existence
in that case it's always
but yes
they are not always involved in government stuff
journalists are targeted sometimes
also they already spied a lot of people with arcaneos i think
probably like at least 50% of it is in the us
really?
ideological differences
about that at all
no idea
do they bomb random places?
explain
great
a lot of stuff don't even care about the constitution anymore
that just means that you are using wrong version of python
very interesting
how could a law expire
a bill isn't a law
it's never a lot at these levels
well, a few
there seems to be a lot people that is just above level 50
me who has no idea about the us political system:
what reasons
when more bootrom bugs
suffer
is there any difference between compiling for a7 and a8
so yes
they are paranoid
iphone 15 mte wen
mte bypass when
all arm64e binaries on or before 18a188 is incompatible with ios 14.0b1
so is there real reason for pac if mte is enforced
logic bugs 100%
fugu14 exploit chain though
surely pointer access are memory access?
would that cover what pac is doing
pac seems to be governing a subset of memory violations
is pac really governing anything that mte is not governing
that's can be improved i think
because it's only abi unstable
how about mte
no more launchctl shortage then
when vtool macos launchctl
which somehow has weaker cpu then a display
4k 2 is arm64e no?
all checkra1n devices are arm64 without arm64e
they are all arm64
audioos binaries are still compatible with tvos binaries
does not really matter until apple decided that they should have incompatible binaries
and some other are arm64e in ilp32 mode
watch is armv7k
or watchos since that came earlier
tvos moment
sounds like a bad idea
should i try to make an android-tools build system myself
that's the one that generate the virtual packages no?
so only tools are installed in the end
that moment when the android-tools build system does not generate shared libraries or install headers and static libraries
unless it can somehow be used independently
if it's internal, keep it in the zebra package
pro's firmware isn't zebra firmware tool?
that stuff should be in bootstrap repos
id go with 12.2
putting the firmware package on any repo seems like a bad idea
`firmware` is generated during bootstrap preparation no?
not zebork
i use sileo
and for other stuff, that should be determined at runtime
the correct solution of that is to have different dist for different ios and actually use dpkg architecture
there's quite some special phone numbers that does not have the normal number of digits tho
there's like 2 special 3-digit phone numbers in my region and one of it is just an alias for the other
that would work like roaming even if that works
my webpage should load quickly on that
china 3g is not others 3g
it's a different protocol and band
yep this is
limit wifi usage of apps
it is just that esims are not really a thing in china
don't think so
all otas are 9.9.
tsschecker
shows 14.1 as signed
source code layout is not an api
very true
also the zstd patch breaks
i think
if an app detected every file in the base bootstrap vnode won't work
it moves file around i think
idk, is that talking about the usb controller?
technically correct
before first unlock
and then the device should be jailbreak-unbricked
of course, after you reset, the rootfs is still  dirty so someone should immediately restore rootfs
yeah so the device isn't actually "jailbreak-bricked" if dpkg bricks on an unc0ver-only device
i think it will also delete the dpkg directories
we are talking about apt 2.5 while we they are still on apt 1.8
don't think modern jbs stash files
reset all contnets and settings
but not completely obviously
and optionally revert to that snapshot before reboot because that will happen anyways during boot
no, it reverts the snapshot name
we have checkra1n on android, we must complete the loop
troll
basically that
so i am trying to make it so that you can use an iphone to root and android
wait that's illegal
doubleh3lix is ok on 64 bit
h3lix is not-very-good-but-you-have-to-use-it on 32 bit, while sockh3lix is good on 64 bit
this is totally illegal
linking adb for ios
worse than sockh3lix
tns has bad bad success rate
all others are 64 bit
only h3lix is 32 bit
(sockh3lix has better exploit)
and sockh3lix is also for 64 bit so there is no real reason to use doubleh3lix
everything except amyh3lix is ok
h3lix chain
sockh3lix, doubleh3lix
the issue is "zebra won't install"
note: i told them beforehand it will break something because it is ios 12 bootstrap on ios 10
two people installed that and it does not work
man that's harder than expected
apt moment
nevermind turns out libiosexec on the repo is just a bit broken
` libiosexec-dev : depends: libiosexec1 (= 1.0.20~1.1-alpha1) but 1.0.20~1.2-alpha1 is to be installed`
iphoneos-arm64 1300 ios 10
it existed for a while
bad jb
biggest problem right now is prs are not getting merged or commented
ios 9 armv7 is only for ramdisk
except for armv7 ios9
time  to build it for every supported  target
apt appears to build fine (!)
newest git?
it's in todo
i can't be bothered to do the perl part
do moreutils
im building it
already 24 hours late! unacceptable!!
building apt 2.5.0 now
ra1npoc is used on windows
moment
ra1nproc
checkra1n team confirmed to not be equivalent to checkra1n guy
it does
because it's more universal
the person that put gentoo on 486
still a 486 class cpu
yeo kheng meng? although that's am5x86
that should run checkra1n
also the pc must at least be 486 compatible on x86 architecture
on amd
i think
it can work if the usb controller is directly attached to the cpu a without a hub
ill get t6000 instead of t8103
the only case i have see checkra1n to work in vm is some kvm pci passthrough setup
checkra1n uses undefined behaviour about the usb stack
it's just that vm software does not execute the undefined behaviour in a good way
no that's not the biggest problem with virtual machine
microsoft surface pro x sq2
and have working usb ports
not every windows machine can dualboot linux
aka nick chan
i already ordered a macbook pro
amd mobile cpu has less problems with checkra1n
4039 days
that still is the longest wait i think
pretty sure yes
edge still going here
not in my region
if they even exist right now
ios 4.2.5 users be crying
that means you close it from app switcher and open it again
pretty sure it still works
this device is also armv7
download the linux version that matches your phone's architecture
using armv7 to jailbreak arm64 moment
jailbreak iphone by connecting iphone to android
got too many androids
i think
i should try to run checkra1n on android again
just much better the enterprise
maybe 60 days? they still get revoked
to query
you send json to it
there's canister
slower than enterprise certs tho
it would revoke rather quickly
device limit of each type is 100
i mean best would to install their udid profile
i think so
this isn't $5 or $2
and you are not dealing with apple tvs on apple watches without mac
especially if you have a pc
say it here
it's not filtered
undefined
technically you can hack ios 4 onto 2g
ios version?
properly
you can't say what iphone you have
sounds like you shouldn't jailbreak even if you can
ipad 2
iphone 3g
se gen 2
without blobs
i use idevicerestore
cameren be looking us
and it's not filtered i think
it is the udid one
you sent the link before
uhh $9.99 year would do but the $14.99 year one seems better
(no piracy btw)
or go to a specific site and cheap out on a developer account
always
this part gets developed first
this is high priority
altstore
running android 10
better than  a certain android owned by me
ah yes, almost no drivers moment
arch linux btw
wen nick chan jb
wen eta segmentation fault
make one
~~totally not spyware~~
(although not really untethered)
untether
but the untether one is right
normal
uhh, some university i guess
capt screaming
disable real time protection
not smoked too much
smokin very cool
alexk
does that still exist
muted role
however it's permanent role
it's a bit more complicated to get than nitro booster in that you have to ask an admin but still pretty easy
giveaways sponsor is also p2w
there's iclouddll and itunesdll folders
also ships pirated itunes and icloud dll
blue shield
happy birthday
tim cook
rsa should be cracked by then
wait uhh 200 years
the signature server
isn't it tss
buy another device
some checkra1n versions disables usb restricted mode
ipad 9
let's just say that there are 3 gb ram a13 devices
how about a9x
and ipod touch 7
because t8012
a10(x) support is rather likely
so you can ssh?
is there no zebra?
that's somewhere between b8 and release
which beta
iphone 13 never got 14
i told you that before
considering that it puts an ios 12 bootstrap on ios 10
it will probably break something
he drops jb out of nowhere
nothing important
and now it has to be packaged
newest version of apt
(not related to you)
well, a few hours ago
apt 2.5 just dropped
unreal!
is there anywhere that's actually selling these devices
the first thing to jb ios 4.2.5 is to actually have such a device
what does that mean
how jb 4.2.5
iphone 4 ios 4.2.5
you should know your device model and software version
recovery mode
you can still downgrade to signed versions
is it the nor flash?
so recovery loop
iboot is in nor
due to user error
so there are some worries that we may get recovery loops instead of bootloops
it holds kernel, diags (if there is one), and the firmware blobs
so i don't think it will do that
and nukes something in the sep i think
pretty sure yes
and see it's in dfu mode
until you plug it into a pc
no signs of life
dfu loop
i don't think apps manager will hack anything
you can use ios-ota-downgrader
leetdown?
leetdown
not really
generally you can only use the app sandbox paths
(well, except my own binaries)
i don't get that much crashes even on a 2 gb ram device
it looks like it is some tweaks causing it
then press restore rootfs
press "done"
come on
your choice really
restore rootfs + reset all contents and settings
i think usb c break more easily
jailbreakd is much better now + saurik did not hate jailbreaking
no issue understanding it
i read his tweets
this is very real
i  think i should update procursus docs
he do blockchain stuff
cylio
sidea
cydia is a worm that feeds on apples
bingner weeb moment
sileo is not developed by coolstar for a long time
what is a stash
stash?
then just make a backup before jailbreak
at least i used that to test odysseyra1n
wdym abuse
this is still a giant trustcache though
and there are blobs
there is no 1.1.3 source code
not really
~~technically someone can just throw a giant 700 kb trustcache and bootstrap the device with procursus~~
fugu14 tcp shell
for fugu14
you can still use idownload after reboot tho
not tethered to apple's server or a pc
fugu14 i think
no need for bindfs
we would just nuke handle_eval_rootauth by then
uptime flex moment
i can see why tethered isn't that bad though
but most people do not like it regardless
maybe it isn't
checkm64
because most people do not want tethered
that's something else
that isn't a workaround
can't boot at all without pc
spin up another vm before running ios, but it runs linux
you need to use idevicerestore
because we are patching amfi anyways
it should be whatever you are booting from but it doesn't matter
python3 create_apticket.py n104ap buildmanifest.plist ticket.shsh2 root_ticket.der
create_apticket.py or rip them from tss if it's signed
you can have a space between arch and linux
ya know
who even manages canister
not on canister i think
and no kpf for s8000
there's no nvme support for s8000
that's for running securerom only
entry point is the kernel
that is, shebang execs are passed to kernel
for some reason libiosexec appears to be broken
the ipsw
kernelcache.research.iphone12b
development kernels does not work for some reasons
use the research kernelcache
appledisplay2,1
at least darwinos worked for me
i mean, other a13s also sorta work
literally iphone 11
iphone 11, n104ap
just realized
child apple id
15 has issues, 13 is completely broken
14.8 should be good
use another apple id
you should prepare the ios firmware now
later steps takes a bit longer
nah it's uneven
i have a faulty sensor in my pc that always report itself to be 127.5 degrees
but uh, cpu don't shut themselves down unless they are like 105 degrees
i keep my cpus cool
my cpu never exceed 65 degrees when maxed out
segmentation fault: 11
error: xx not found
check out the wiki
it's mostly about the troll part tho
rip bozo
~~13~~
but that's obviously also not the case here
supervision by someone else legally required
it runs rather badly everywhere, you can't use hvf, hax or kvm for the ios vm
just use the funny qemu fork
we can do ios 15.6b1 kernel debugging without corellium
but it still wouldn't hard brick (aside from icloud lock)
you will lose some factory calibration data
that's hardware volume
to the jailbreak
so e.g. the codesign checks are gone but there is no point of entry
it would be like jailbroken without any jailbreak stuff at all
also it would boot even if checkra1nfs upload failed
what is syscfg
refuses to accept binpack (checkra1nfs) upload
checkra1nrd probably tho
no, it would be in checkra1nfs or checkra1nrd
someone would patch that
why not ispremium or isdeviceabrick
light mode is bright
too bright
really
but why
easy to see what did i do
in mount
-o ro
there are no headers on that site
found substrate headers
where are the libhooker headers also
i suppose you can still call the lh* functions right?
how hard would it be to write plain c tweaks
not at all
i use tapi for that
probably while staring at ghidra as well
instead
do i craft the headers by hand
no idea
ktool generates empty headers for libioreport
it uses some stuff from the directories
it isn't
last time i tried
with clang and stuff
i mean without xcode
they are undefined symbols hell
you just scp the image onto the device then attach and mount it
ransom
any idea on how to compile `dyld_shared_cache_util` `dyld_closure_util` ,`dyld_usage` , `dyld_shared_cache_builder`, `dyld_info` and `chroot_util`
hey capt
tss probably uses hardware security modules
tss private key
just steal the hsms
ios 4.2.5
~~asks tss to allow you to demote it~~
bootloop entitlement
funny entitlement!
com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes
does it again
to check the rootfs integrity
that's flag_tr
doesn't mean iboot will respect it
there's also com.apple.nvram.boot-args-set-allow
the entitlement is not a boolean
mind you
it's not a boolean
if device has internal security policy
`com.apple.private.iokit.system-nvram-internal-allow`
time to diff diskarbitration
sshhhh there's the control file
discord \_\_formatting\_\_ moment
or make a deb with nothing
all right
a10 boot chain says hi
iboot is ios bootloader
rd=null
wait that's wrong panic
jetsam_proc_name_panic=1
that only matters in restore mode
idk it crashes before serial is initialised
that makes the kernel think that it has no ram and cpu
cpus=0
maxmem=0
serial=3 is fine
so the checkra1n stuff is never ran in the userspace
so you are overriding that
checkra1n itself sets root device to md0
that works even in 14.8.1
it looks since ios 15 you can't root from hfs plus on persistent storage
`root-live-fs=1` no?
new xnu sources just dropped
that's called restore ramdisk
root-live-fs=1
maybe
amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 debug=0x14e kextkog=0xffff wdt=-1 serial=3
that looks like you patched iboot incorrectly
that's also a panic
better than my profile banner tho
now i mess with boot args using a funny qemu fork
right?
initproc exited
what happens without it
-restore rd=md0 -progress enable-nand-reformat=1
in a normal boot, it is hardcoded
hardcoded or rd= rootdev= boot argument
hardcoded
how? by attaching a thousand of 4 kb disk images
this is take a while ago
note: ios seems to refuse to have more than 1020 disks
you mount on a directory
you don't mount on a file
what is the exact error
1 gb would be
too much ram consumption
then it is a hfs plus image
well, maybe it support nfs as well, but i haven't figured that one out as well
ios only support hfs plus and apfs in kernel
you need to unmount
it's a raw image
now enjoy your 64 mb volume
run `mount` to check
i think even with that re-key error it mounted anyways
actually
you can just unplug the usb after launching checkra1n
because i know at least 1 person that is not me using such a crappy pc
man the i686 iso won't boot on 256 mb ram if i do that
there it is
`attach` binaries since those their source code are available
i can just send the binaries over
i think
that would prevent it from working if the pc have an openssh version that is too new
but yes i did identify an issue with odysseyra1n script a while ago
you used macos?
- or - grab the hdik binary from the ramdisk in the ipsw
use odysseyra1n
you should never add a bootstrap repo for another bootstrap
try it
since hdik only exists on the ramdisk for ios 12
i think it's this
but to create a new hfs+ volume this should work:
is it mounted on anything
`mount` may give the answer
ok so
also what ios are you on
that's a read-only compressed dmg
you can't format the checkra1n binpack
protip: try it on checkra1n
that's part of firmware
nevermind
tr is part of procursus
wait nvm
more panics
bruh wtf `cowardly refusing to revert snapshot on ios because it would permanently corrupt the filesystem (something is broken on the devices)`
the bootstraping
uh, i guess it semi-worked
kernel panic 1 second after trying that
yes it is
unlike in actual checkra1n
because in qemu-t8030 there is no unionfs
it is
let me see if i can reproduce it without using the script
i think it panicked trying to rename some snapshot
there is a bug in qemu-t8030, no other way!
it panicked again!
why is it trying to use a nonexistent command
but odysseyra1n-install.bash tries to use it
`tr` is not in the checkra1n binpack
because i don't except it to work  on first try
well i have apfs snapshot prepared to deal with this situation
in the middle of bootstrapping
bootstrap a13 with odysseyra1n
i mean like
a13 odysseyra1n
using an ios vm to test odysseyra1n is too cursed
while it still works on debian stable given out oudated it is
so e.g. someone trying to use odysseyra1n on kali would not be able to use it already
about 40 days
until it doesn't work anywhere
as they upgrade to scp 9.x
so eventually the current script will be broken on more and more systems
it's more updated such that it contains scp 9.x instead of scp 8.x
now that i actually gets to test it
but anyways time to fix odysseyra1n in the iso
grepping the help message
we can't just use -o unconditionally, since old scp does not recognise it
there is no scp --version option yet we need to detect the version
but not in other contexts
yes, because in the isos, scp is guaranteed to be scp 9.0+
as we don't want to break older scp hosts with an unknown option
so in other contexts this would be rather difficult to fix
however there are no good way to detect scp version
not hard to fix in context of odysseyn1x, just use the -o option to force legacy behaviour
so odysseyra1n script is broken on all hosts with scp 9.0+
scp 9.0+ uses sftp and checkra1n binpack does not have sftp
so, there is a very serious problem
cpu emulation is slow
i need to give it some time to make sure lockdown is running
very ugly method but ssh works this way so can probably test
me trying to test odysseyra1n in odyseeyn1x a9x without actually having a test device:
and emojiport would still be possible
not having the patch the actual executable
the idea of tweaks is this
since the files on disk does not matter at all for tweaking as long as you can bend the behaviours of the running processes
this is pretty much the only thing i can think of that is actually impossible
not possible in *that* way
only the behaviour of running process ultimately matters
why would it be impossible
there is no inherent reason it have to
** historically relying on being able to modify the rootfs
and the integrity of amfid itself is verified by comparing it to a hardcoded list of trusted hashes
\*some\* progress has been make, just not what is mentioned in the announcement
taurine 1.0.2 moment
trying to execute directories creates a kernel panic
not  answering you
apt-ftparchive
first i have to spin up an ios 14 vm first
should be similar enough
ok, i decided i will test odysseyra1n bootstrapping with qemu-t8030
if they use macos it would be much easier to explain
mount(8) should be easier to understand then mount(2)
i sent 5000 messages in 2 weeks...
from my experience if you send messages really hard, you can have a level every 4 days up until level 50
it's more like another 30 levels as level are log scaled
and then use the iso as the linux vm in the qemu-t8030 setup
i can just grab the checkra1n binpack and mount it in qemu-t8030
i mean if i really wanted qemu-t8030 can be made to work for that...
this time the fix is attempt to install sileo 2.3 instead of sileo 2.1-1 which is not present on the filesystem
more like it never worked
except that it is not
i released yet another version of checkn1x_a9x_kerninfo_pongoos trying to fix odysseyra1n but i have no test devices so...
and a repo can have arm64, amd64, all packages at the same time
but anyways
the 10%
yeah, so it's "strange"
it isn't weird 90% of time
we don't know
2. please don't use caps lock like that
it's just statistically more likely
given the exceptionally large amount of whitenames
i mean...
unless you are somehow faster than aaron of course
aaron will
that looks like an unc0vermoment
found watchos 8.6 ipsw
instant noodles
why don't you block him
(to your server?)
they are very similar if your "computer" can connect to the internet
they are
judging from pongo commit + hack different discord, siguza is the only one working on it
semi-tethered
checkra1n team is just siguza
but `sizeof(checkra1n_team) == sizeof(person_t)` right now
because it looked like real information
it's very bad
also why is whois setup like that on procursus
so procurs.us are going to their servers (?)
it's the battery that keeps the clock running when the pc is off
you do realize the motherboard battery is not the main battery?
shortcut theming isn't very good
you can also remove the motherboard battery (not the main one) for 20 seconds then reinstall it although i think that's harder
then you have to open it up
battery is harder to remove imo
shut down the pc, find the pins labeled `jbat1` on the motherboard, then connect the two pins together with a metal object for 20 seconds
it will also reset all firmware settings
you can erase that password by shorting the jbat1 pins on the motherboard
just short the jbat1 jumper
back then you need to jailbreak to get apps at all
less useful
not useless
then your device is literally jailbreak bricked if no other jailbreaks supports it
like *what*
using dpkg to bootstrap the device only to have it removed right after
not hard for unc0ver team, hard for everyone else
calling dpkg to restore rootfs
hi rick!
not impossible
that's called buying a new phone
3. it doesn't turn on,figure out how to turn it on first
2. i don't think it has icloud lock
1. not an issue for me
nothing after 14 days of being plugged in
there's no heat when i plug it in
i mean no signs of life at all
it's an iphone 6 for me
me when i have an iphone that appears to be in near perfect condition except it won't turn on:
loaded a loading gif no?
wdym, it has loaded
it's just left with a dead battery for uhh 3 years (?)
i don't think the iphone 6 damaged
no signs of life after being plugged in for 14 days
i have an iphone 6 that's like this
need metal, iomfb and sep tho
idk what is missing
i have containermanagerd still in launchd.plist
any sandboxed process would just hang though
bash loaded i guess
that's a lot
when on a8
checkra1n is ok on that
just no jb
canister
a good jb does not require you to downgrade the jb tool to jb old versions
idk why anyone would think amyh3lix is a good idea
don't want to sideload it just for that
what does the amyh3lix ui looked like anyways
you *may* have to restore so that's a warning
normal
it's in procursus discord
i posted the ipa just to show it *can* be compiled
ios 12 bootstrap on ios 10
but it's bad
amyh3lix
i think
i posted the ipa somewhere
int8_t
please stop mentioning that person
use chimera1n v1
mostly
also not all gnu stuff work on ios
because it's like this in appleinternal
bsd userspace fits ios more
some people are still on legacy bootstrap
but no token logger
uikittools-ng main contains serena code now
well, paranmat
dabezt is unbanned in sileo if that matters
a discord server
dabezt left sileo server tho
and flower's secret
and exams
studies ig
same reason im dead for 7 months
they were *accused* of token logging
and flower left
ios 15 became the first version to take more than 200 days to jb
mind you im completely dead & stuck on level 46 from 17 nov 2021 to 5 may 2022
why did you eat them
a lot of stuff happened
we haven't talked in a while
you can try that
but change info.plist
then idk how it detects it then
~~blocking off some requests with an adblocker~~
to actually add it like a dist repo
sileo have hardcoded bigboss.org tho
so idk about that
the pfp isn't in contact with the nickname
no idea
~~screentimebegone (beta)~~
so two forks
there's also hayden's fork of cydia
so far i only know of one occurance of whitename edition
until whitename edition happens more
no more being whitemame for a few months
only if you are a11 or below
for real
go to sleep
when jailbroken, dyld_insert_libraries is set to load the tweak injector, which would then load the tweaks
libhooker is not on procursus
they are probably talking about a jailbroken situation
whatever
flower is cool
which would have a **white name** displayed
but it refers to anyone with level 14 or below as well
i have seen it to occur once
i hope whitename edition won't happen more
but many are
whitename pro (you are not)
i don't need 20 copies of chromium on my pc
context menu commands are actually good tho
why does discord thing a chat_input commands are a good idea smh
and false trigger happens a lot
calling dpkg to restore rootfs moment
i would rather not hate on anyone
but let's not hate on people
and you have to do it for every device * every supported build
hardcoded offsets moment
man ik some people are stuck on 14.4b1 and cannot jb
200 years maybe
no way
that can be jailbroken
buy another device
you can't
on wwdc
definitely not iphone 14
who has iphone 14
fairphone
never
that's the "ipsw" contents
(this is release)
they have no storage
it's a cpio
perl?
like in a normal restore except there is no storage to restore to
and yes the ios device boot them up from dfu when it's connected
and runs off a restore ramdisk the ios devices sends it
pid 1 is already the converter
there's no launchd tho
and the adapter has its own os to convert it
so they device sends h.264 encoded data to the adapter
lightning don't have enough bandwidth
maybe, the chip is quite similar to the a6  i think
that runs xnu
let's just say it comes it's own cpu and ram, and has a mmu
adapter runs xnu moment
most bloated adapter ever
as well as:
deez nuts
two of those devices are apple tv 2 and 3
is still receiving updates for ios 8
like 4 distinct devices
for a few devices
that moment when apple still maintains ios 8
m1 pro apple tv
that moment when a display has a more powerful chip than the latest apple tv and most androids
i think it's like 512 mb
how much memory does t8012 have
apple is pretty much the opposite of planned obsolescence on phone updates
t8012 will probably be the oldest chip running the newest whateveros by then
for as long as intel mac is getting updates
remember they have to support t8012
will probably support ios 16
and no signed older ota either
captos
clothos
ratio
now that's actually great and mit licensed
wen apple bundles micro in macos
~~although it still manages to have features not in pico~~
probably
you mean siguza
now that's a gpl3 moment
a 2007 bash tho
probably bash 3.2 and libreadline7 not liking ncurses 6
mind you
it's not a gpl moment
idk why apple didn't update to ncurses 6
actually
libncurses5.4 isn't going away
yeah so "a bit"
complain what
otherwise architecture: all is useless
but it's allowed
this is allowed
there is
too many real
real gn
but it's a vm
how to get rid of that bloatware called xcode
you can't have `com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes` on stock tho
but with auto-boot it's more fun
i said bootloop
that make sure you have 0 bytes left on disk
and the chflags is also for extra fun
extra fun
no it just creates two regular files
and studio display
the funny fork where you can get bash on ios 15.6b1
im not rich
i didn't use corellium
all right
ios vm
i tried that in a vm
it would ebusy
still won't work
6 won't work
come on
posting rick's id is not bait
so that's technically useless ping
sudo apt install com.studiodisplaycake.forkbomb
piracy
that's a fork bomb
mount_tmpfs
don't violate rule 5
you must make a tmpfs mount
won't work with ssv
unreal
killall backboardd
or setup.app
before sb would run
need to emulate those as well
sep and metal tho
plus i would like to mess with qemu-t8030 again
but it looks like some the the deps is just broken
not an issue of compiling ffmpeg itself
still want to verify my ffmpeg 5 pr
im trying to make ffmpeg depends compile
but you need qxl drivers in the guest
it should have ok performance
qxl should work on that no?
idk about that
qemu windows
is good
---accel hax -vga qxl
intel haxm
with -accel hax
qemu on windows is ok i think
i think that's quite bad
yes qemu vm
no it's very fast
i have a macos vm
and then kernel panic during unxip
how about 13.4
bruh wtf is it xcode 13.3 libtool again
troll
(not now tho obviously)
if i ever get dev it will be advanced dev right away
advanced dev
i don't want to be whitename pro
i have too little xp
1950: we will have flying cars in the future
so we unlock it ourselfs
not engineer issue
that's just a designer issue imo
so you can't do anything interesting
it is just that it will allocate over itself
you can still trigger the use after free
this is a completely fake header written by me
the user_*_t thing is so annoying i need  to make a header to make it shut up
pwnd:checkm9
it's unpatched in ios 13.0b1
it's just the interval is bigger
that happened on 13.5 again
hawking radiation
man building tesseract
then yocto (?)
femto and atto i think
so it's 1e6 times smaller
micro is 10^-6
1e6 times smaller
1000 times in fact
how about micro
average 2008 website
procursus does not have alpine pico tho
luca loves nano no?
vim ewww
but then on a7 and a8 you can just use checkm8 so
it's not a lot but it's not a very small number either
but you will hurt your hands by having to enter dfu like... uhh 100 times?
dfu nonce collision tho
more accurately you need a way to set nonce or be on a7 or a8
man where's sillysock
and silly-o
if you share at least one server with it that is
gm hydrate
nukes all warnings and werrors
also illegal hint: `-w` in cflags makes a lot of stuff to compile
google's snappy
not bingner's snappy
building linsnappy
i hate it when it doesn't take very long to compile  then takes forever to  link
bootstrap guy moment
i think it  is a bit messed up?
`ifneq (,$(findstring darwin,$(memo_target)))` is if `darwin` found in`$(memo_target)`, do something
my ipad name is set to dqw4w9wgxcq
and ifeq means if equals, ifneq means if not equal
findstring tries to find the string "darwin" in memo_target and return it, then it is compared to a empty string
let me explain
that's wrong
(beyond what's needed to make rust stuff compile for ios)
that will never happen
im not learning rust
until you call the unsafe functions that is
i hate this
fr i need to cargo install cargo-c
do i need to install rust for arm64_32
it's listed as such in procursus docs
how does tutanota sponsor procursus
i don't see any problems with it
the current one is good
but some  ffmpeg dependencies uses it
i hate rust
how do i install rustup
libass is just built
because im trying to verify whether my ffmpeg 5 pr works
bootstrap guy has all the answers
ifeq (,$(findstring darwin,$(memo_target)))
doesn't look like part of macos
you need -lcrypt
tha's my solution
i run my own smb & nfs server
man probably got 4.9 gb free in icloud
undefined-behaviours-less
but it should because the exploit does not involved any undefined behaviours
about the 15 ones
on 15.4.1
100% success rate
all logic bugs
the fugu14 bugs are better
sock puppet worked up to 12.3b6
12.4 unpatched 12.3b7 i think
so apple *does* know about the exploit itself, just not for that version
it's another  patched then unpatched exploit
what u0 used on 13.5
it's like a 0.5 days tho
apple screwed up 12.4 and 13.5
where
"security updates"
let's see what will happen
building apple's source code = header hunting
idk about vim
so make sure to check the tags
apple sometimes does not put the newest stuff on main
it uses the newest stuff in headers
so you might need to delete some existing headers as well
basically you need to use xnu 8020.101.4 headers for it to work
for network-cmds
there's another thing though
does anyone at apple even look at that now
time to go to lists.apple.com
it's just a timezone moment
nah it's 0
outdate it it is then
so i'm not updating my pr to that
(please click)
so it also introduced many new bins and issues
i tried to compile as much as possible out of every cmds
also remember
system-cmds-918.100.3
it's not
basically it's because macosx.sdk headers misses some stuff
system-cmds i think
all the apple-cmds
i did update in my fork
e.g. you can copy all the photos off the device and it's fine
just not icloud of itunes backup
you can copy data off the device tho
reset all contents and settings
you just don't
so unless you know exactly what files to delete in the backup
there may be jailbreak files in the backup
after jailbreak that is
and you must not restore an icloud or itunes backup
should be fine
reset all contents and settings
and if you find one that works make sure to report it there
you enumerate through all the available bypasses
i think
jailbreaks.app has the ipa
i think im level 49
check my xp
but im very fine today
idk i just want to have member edition
to which i have absolutely no idea why
idk it just says unc0ver is a music artist
what's wrong with youtube
it's real
why is unc0ver a music artist now
unc0ver supports xr 14.7
unc0ver
download checkra1n there
looks like clicking on invite without  account
not even a talk
it's just a few images
actually
man got mad over some talk about a political figure
idk, but dm spam tho
man just called cameren an animal although it's technically true
that's a use after free
nah, the pointer points to nowhere so it's undefined
let's see what he says tho
he really needs chill i think
spam + chill bro
where is the command that starts with m
system policy: process-exec-interpreter bash(36) deny(1)
hold onto that version, i think you should upgrade when checkra1n supports it
which phone
cameren  is always imaginary
i mean the blobs you have
what versions of blobs you have
they call it "chinese-flavoured socialist" i think
china isn't really communist now
i can get why some people get trigged over it but let's be chill ok?
chill bro
deez nuts
uninterruptible sleep
d state says hi
ratio
those 10000 subs no video spammers
get real
considering youtube's inconsistent moderation that's not a given
rickroll lmao
cydia and sileo does not better, the bootstrap does
about 12 hours
it saves blobs for you when you are jailbroken
how long does it take to build ffmpeg
there's a thing called shshd
you can also upgrade with blobs no?
"almost"
15.2 came out a while ago
but, probably  not
anyways
i just use parts of my legal name moment
international shipping isn't cheap i think
appstore++
you mean a8-a11
anyways
checkra1n is dead
that's ew theme
yeah this has been posted here 20 times
probably not
ios 13.5 took shorter (?)
if you want low end, sure it's cheaper
that has a lot of chinese stuff
bigboss tho
too many eta kids
ipad pro 9.7 moment
right now
only apple device
in fact
only jailbroken device i own
still a critical device for me
i have a 2 gb ram device
and 13.4.1
se 2 gen came out with ios 13.4
ios 10.3.3 on 5s isn't to bad i think
but yes not useful
that means it cannot be delayota'd to
h3lix
the locked serials are stored on apple's servers
it's difficult to replace iphone storage
are we?
timezone exists
but pls get rid of phone
frp is much worse tho
if you connect a icloud locked device to a pc then runs `ideviceinfo -k brickstate` it will return true
ya know
icloud lock is actually one of the ways to hard brick an iphone
no purpose
plus most jailbreaks requires springboard access
the 24th page
via a server side switch
let's just say if you avoid the strings and make your app do nothing while being tested it's probably not too hard to sneak exploits
gba4ios is on the app store for like a day
probably fake
pp client
don't believe it's hard to sneak exploits into app store
don't see any issue
and we can sideload now
sandbox still exists
also utm
and 3g
3 devices
what is icraze's repo
yeah obviously you need the phone as well
practically you can only make them with macos
that works for checkra1n
we don't use modchips
when saving blobs
nothing should happen to the phone
jelbrek
taurine 1.1.3 is closed source in every sense
more important question where is 1.1.3 partial source
it's really complicated
man still invisible
to flex i guess?
that moment when apple said there will be ios 14 security updates only for those to be dead after exactly 1 security update
how does people use those fonts without their eyes exploding
15.4.1 is signed
and 15.4.1
you use youtube reborn for that
you don't
i actually somewhat needed the new apis on new ios versions, but i guess i can still make it work with 14.3 for now
basically if you just make ispremium or something like that always returns true than it's piracy
now whether that is piracy depends on exactly *how* it is implemented
and that's just not the point of jailbreaking
you can already do that without jb
let's just say
it's not any better
remember that ios 14 untether?
i call ios 12 really old
it generated *a lot* of interest
checkm8 is a godsend tho
and most of them are at least half decent
thought it's limneos
real newterm 3
i have it in github actions
i have it
isn't zebra 2 dead since like june 2021
bootstrap packages makes extensive use of them
big issue if you use a lot of bootstrap packages
ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma
or "when it's done"
eventually
sileo discord?
sometimes jailbreaks does not like ota'ed phones
another possible outcome is bootloop
or rather, tried
how is that related to you
sileo is best
or saily
at least better than installer
not that it's good
cydia works fine
rip bozo
(not actually rule 12 violation though)
i have said "wen eta" "when eta" multiple times i would be instantly muted
but no that won't work
slim handles the bot
aka: when signing party
procursus by cameron
what ecen is the context of the message
i use reddit ... by that i mean i have an account
cydia won't work on rootless
probably a lot
"i consent  to have all my personal info sell and published, as well as be used for legal and research purposes" i wonder how many people would click that
pretty sure the discord ui forces you to now
sileo?
to be fair that's multiple times
now of course be able to install something doesn't mean it will work
in what way
lowerinstall may work
also gm alpha
please don't use bootloopomatic
it can be a disease
that bot is by m1sta i think (?)
not this server tho
redsn0w is for like... uhh ios 4?
also when u0 started having ads
out of absolutely nowhere u0 team said they will support ios 13.5
although 13.5 is a pleasent surprise
not happening
how does  a fake jb not work
fake jb
and probably a webclip
you will get human verification and surveys
green phone?
14.8.1 dead as well
there's actually
ios 15.5 jailbreak no pc no human verification no survey no confirmation no manually enable
microsoft jelbrek
~~ik some do anyways but let's ignore that~~
and people don't call altstore a jailbreak
euid = 0 means basically nothing on stock ios without extra perms
honestly i don't see it would happen to this scale
when eta "illegal because only allowing apple apps to use com.apple.private.securiry.no-container is anti-competitive"
i can't see they open up hypervisor, jit, fork and exec
thanks
it exists in ipados, sentinel can trigger it
very real
samsung galaxy note 7
pls no it will explode
greater than you think
that still do iphone 3gs battery replacement
is there any place
which afaik is hell to compile
discuss what?
it worked on 12
for windows
then 7zip is good
(not that 7zip is bad)
xarchiver and ark is good
just make sure to run defuse.sh
it will even with tcti's terrible performance
never crashes
i have linux vm on utm that uses 32 mb ram
256 mb is enough
considering how old windows 95 is, yes
000 000007 is valid windows 95 activation code
back when windows xp it would refuse to work
pirated windows now is like pirated winrar tho
i recognize that
then upgrade to windows 10
i hate detection
just get some crappy android and be done with it
never have to worry about bypass that way
i use $130 (us dollars) androids for banking and crap
your choice really but i won't
what *actually* matters as far as tweaks are concerned is the running processes (and the kernel), not files on disk
basically all tweaks can work on rootless tho
basically
no writing to system volume
you still can
but save 15.4.1 blobs now
ios 15 jb will be rootless
and if it doesn't crash in 191 days i don't really see it crsahing randomly
don't think so
jailbroken too
14.0.1 is meh
unless im hacked
not like im going to get banned or kicked anyways
and you have 50
i have 150
whitenames are actually blacknames in embed colour
how much xp does lemonade have anyways
and even for non-jailbreaking purposes, pac and arm64e are also quite significant
welcome to whitename+
big difference for jailbreaking
a11 and a12
apple's repair machines can probably give ip68 when used properly
after repair
apple's machines are overkill unless you want ip68
apple machines surely looks imitating
how about apple tooling
~~self service repair~~
looks ok
no jb
blob bible
sep, baseband, rose, u1, fdr, savage, nonce, entangled_nonce ...
that's only accurate all the way back to ios 4
then you don't have blobs
that's the question
wen airpower
rich people smh
battery replacement (real)
ios 15
ipad mini 4
bad features
0.1%?
and mempro is like
member plus really is top 1%
if you leave afaik no way to check
(for real)
you leave
you can
and yes im using android rn
discord android must be bugged
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow i have member edition
it's not linear
that's what log scale basically means
logarithmic scale
level is log scale
don't think that applies to mempro
member one is 3+ times xp member edition
in terms of xp gain
and there appears to be no ratelimit
xp farm moment
level 50
im almost spamming messages here
yet so many plugs
"universal" serial bus
better use usb 4
i still have a 30-pin connector but no 30-pin devices
it's slow
than lightning
is faster
my wifi
usb 2.0 moment
~~apple nukes the port instead~~
probably iphone 15
people jailbreak because they want customization
no it's pretty much the reverse
imagine being invisible
quite good imo
adguard
of specific frequencies
so i guess you want to change some sound
april
some sort of sound mixer (?)
im dumb
still don't understand
i think
15.1b3 is the poc15.0.1 thing
anyways
hey you have a 7 mess around
yes 15.0b1 will probably get jb
your patience is probably about the same
ios 13 and 14 don't
ios 15 took over 200 days
no you aren't
80% is to mess around (procursus etc)
but that's only 20% reason
and springboard themes
i jb for youtube tweaks
and there's bsod
shouldn't be too hard to get 7 days uptime
i haven't rebooted in 190 days
but checkra1n is used on that device and version
man i sometimes get stuff wrong
use checkra1n
actually
wait a moment
not sideloadly
must be altstore
install unc0ver with altstore
you can
you have other device right?
l no upgrade button
go studying
man joined again
downgrading with blobs
but good that means my 14.5.1 blobs will be useful
isn't sep compatible down to like 13.4 but iirc there are other issue that prevent it from working
and it works down to 14.3 (14.2?) ?
so, say iphone x and iphone xr can still be restored to 15.1 with blobs
4k tv 2 gen
unless
are there any non-u1 a12s
non-u1?
even with blobs there are no more versions you can restore to on a12+ which have a remotely reasonable chance of a jailbreak in the long-term future
i mean
and blobs are dead too due to sep
update the guide
if you want to sponsor a  giveaway that is
an admin or aaron
make sure restore rootfs is enabled
and try again
reboot
you need to set the permissions to 755
you don't
that probably won't help
you must install with untethering
you must use altstore
man i have to use discord's sed to deal with discord auto convert
im 12 hours apart from that
wdym this server is ok
ios 8.4.1 64 bit
man find out he can't jb 15 and left
but that requires bootrom exploit
demote a device to cpfm 01
wouldn't demotion do that
that's not icloud bypass, that's called "throwing away the locked lock and insert an unlocked lock"
edl is dfu but worse
ez stuff
it is
because that cannot be fixed with a restore
and i consider icloud lock to be hard brick
that would require making it like macos
that can be fixed by dfu
i hope not
does studio display has icloud lock
wait a moment
he is
afaik
there are only two ways to brick idevices anyways
and max out the cpu
unless you disable thermal protection
(although even darwin kernel version can be faked with bootrom exploit)
show ios version + darwin kernel version
and altstore uses a fake macbook  pro i think
they fake a mac
he will get an ibrick trying
union mounts are dead
you can't
and show the darwin kernel version
proof
checkra1n does not support ios 15
but that's more complicated
(or have fugu14 installed first)
you must use altstore
shshd makes the answer a bit complicated
or odyssey or chimera
or taurine
unless they are jailbroken with odysseyra1n before
that method patched?
yeah change systemversion.plist to 6.0.1 and "upgrade" to 6.1.3
because they are a blob of data
that's the best checkm8 nonce setting method right now
real  use hack different ipwndfu and futurerestore set nonce option
since checkm8 was released
that took over 2 years
wait actually i think hack different ipwndfu supports it
and i am on 14.3
then it doesn't count
what?
but nope there are no 15.3 jailbreaks
because he doesn't know...?
like the iphone se 3
~~or get a touch id device~~
disable face id
i checked that
it says no bypass btw
identical twins are a hit or miss with face id
because it is definitely more than 90 days since the next version
please no
it's just that the version that can be upgraded to now does not have jailbreak
that thing still exists
and although you have the blobs you can't use that for 15.3.1 or lower either
then no
which face id cannot be used while jailbroken
which can be jailbroken on an iphone x
you can upgrade to 14.8.1
considering that -l and -k options exists
`chmod 4755 checkra1n` seems like a bad idea
that's checkra1n
np, just remember im not the real cameren
let's just say pojavlauncher is not designed for elucubratus bootstrap
yes for 14.4.2, no for 15.3
not some obscure character
it's a space
let me see
unless that space isn't actually a space
doesn't work
just not that one
it removed the other `__osloglike`s
i still don't get why clang can't recognize bridgeos(x.y)
kext-tools does compile on linux before
it uses crap ton of private headers  so i used it as the test subject
i updated the headers and kext-tools does not compile
that one also moved
like secbasepriv.h
and some headers have been moved
some of them are incredibly outdated
im trying to update main makefile headers
stop using outdated headers
this is a newer version
i know more about this file
aka clean up the main makefile
time to update the headers
and update headers
we better collapse the header downloading in main makefile
and force dfu
no because hard reboot exists
because it does not exist for macos
it shouldn't list it
so no
there's libiosexec.tbd
when ld gets killed: 9
i sometimes has to make -j1
no more race conditions
how about make -j1
super cursed
writing c in shell
no you just run this script
1 and 2 failed
again
time to mess with binutils
no elevation needed
i already described it
too bad
the difference between a normal reboot and userspace reboot is that in a userspace reboot, launchd re-exec itself after tearing down userspace
libass9
it exists
there
icraze be hacking games
remember org.coolstar.fakekernelpanic is still a thing
what does it do
i mean most likely one of the screentime tweaks is causing issues
i would recommend disabling tweak injection into screentimeagent agant
it will mess up your device
just don't use samjet
with jetsamctl
although no matter what you do worst is just a single kernel panic
just make sure not to do jetsamctl -l 1 launchd for obvious reasons
nukes all jetsam limitations persistently
i have tried this multiple times
very safe
so in this case after node died your device returns to normal
it persists for as long as the process
not even
because it doesn't break any rules?
almost all your "available" ram is supposed to be used to cache filesystem contents
restore rootfs + reset all contents and settings exists
no prerm?
disable tweak injection into screentimeagent
so what is samjet
this doesn't look like detection
sounds like some conflicting tweaks
but then an app shouldn't be able to reboot the phone
rejailbreak and try again
then  i guess you actually need to remove something first
on the motherboard then
can you see the a baterry
aka "connect the two metal points near the jbat1 label with a metallic object"
when the pc is off
on the motherboard
you short the jumper labelled jbat1
restore rootfs
ez fix
you have newterm?
you need something like filza or openssh
this is what's happening
dashmoment
pls no
malloc() in swift?
web programming and embedded programming is very different
shorting the cmos jumper...?
snapchat
we don't support snapchat tweaks except those that bypass snapchat detection
if they add hypervisor.framework then maybe
a jailbreak for ios 13
modded youtube client can work
then no
it exists
idk im holding onto ipados 14.3
i think you should
how do i fix segfaulting libtool with gnutls again
which is just a safari skin
and the progress bar is not smooth
does not look native
they are jank
safari extensions?
and not miss every one of them
so i can actually receive emails
but i cleared them
i used to have 3000
how is it like
at the same time
cuz im going to reopen a bunch of prs
cam's notification about to explode (real)
what is your unc0ver version
save boobs
wait till they bundle internalui in an ipsw and publish it
there's a factorysupportramdisk and factoryramdisk included
using some dirty hacks
already ran the firmware in an ios emulator
kernelcache.development.j327
it's about 500 mb in size
there's an actual development kernelcache
download it
that has a development kernelcache
address doxxed
then jb will be dead
cfprefsd.ipa
springboard.ipa
gir cock
hsbc hk is not  a tweak
it's not the same
1. wait 10 years
i should make a real one
if some app can detect divise then idk what to say
divise works on everything
i guess try every bypass
that depends on what app you want to bypass
relative paths, `..`, and `.`
invalid invite
let's just say the invite filter isn't solid at all
"comedy"
ew mee6
parenthesized latin small letter r
there's parenthesized latin small letter a
have you tried all of them
i bet they don't bypass everything that looks like a w in confusables.txt
linux btw isn't filtered
i don't use arch linux by the way
since i think a11moment is still a thing
should i make gui checkra1n isos
has anyone managed to use tswaps
it's also possible to save blobs no jb no pc but that's complicated
pls no
one involves rentering dfu 4 billion times and the other one cannot normally be reached from dfu
we know two
(and a lot ofo ther mitigations)
cuz ktrr is not initiated yet
mind you there is actually a modern jailbreak that does this
and maybe the tfp and mac_mount code as well
yeah just nop and return the codesign check code in kernel text and be done with it
or at least every time you launch a process
the jailbreak is always ongoing for  modern app jailbreaks
"jailbreak completed" is fake
or you are unjailbroken
but basically jailbreakd cannot die
not so sure about u0
it should work for electra 2.0
unless you are on ios 11
don't use ldrestart
launchctl reboot userspace
that's ldrestart
and apple logo will appear
you don't
works as mobile
launchctl reboot userspace
please don't use a hacked up thing like ldrestart
launchctl reboot userspace
gamecenterctl
nyuzika7h took 3 months to read my memo
equally disappointing
let's just say that there are still no sep nonce setters
i think
it needs something from the nand which changed in ios 14
touch is broken
it's half broken on ios 14
project sandcastle
cfw did happen
also remember internet archive will itself crawl stuff to store
there are so many pc firmwares but in the end it's all american megatrends
odysseyn1x probably wouldn't change much
nick chan also vanished
the owner of stkc is stkc
because stkc disappeared
libass is a ffmpeg dependency
real?
macos best for jailbreaking
ios 4
how about jailbreakme 3.0
it does not
you need a higher version of the firmware package
it's so confusing
why can't sileo have better error messages
blue shield
frcoal
it is possible
then don't jailbreak
you don't
imagine ping more than 5 people at once
good morning
hint: don't try it
i think
make a userclient
carbon
objc is a thing on iphone os 3 no?
isn't it install via altstore
ive personally used freebsd it's quite cool
they have very poor apps support
bsds are a bit more consistent
you are making an os from unrealated components
most linux is actually meh in consistentency
most consistent is windows xp
mind you windows 7 basic theme still exist on windows 11
which is basically windows 8
let's not talk about the recovery environment
driverkit cannot be used without kernelmanagerd and there is no kernelmanagerd on ios
manticore discord
that's manticore
one of them is sileo
ye i know another 3 discords
they ported tons of stuff from ios to macos
and we are talking about ios driverkit
for livefiles
and there's also a lifs
ios' fuse ripoff basically
userfs.framework i mean
isn't it userfs?
but at the same time there are no kernelmanagerd
for something
that means they are actually using it
how come apple still compiles driverkit for ios 15.5
then you must use an adaptor
less bloat
it says "bypass kernel memory mitigations"
i suppose one of the bugs linus tweeted is a ppl bypass?
is calculator open source
control pannel + settings
install windows xp
and checkra1n is rather jank on a7
checkra1n with odysseyra1n?
don't see a problem with that
when will they manage the kernel as a package as well
ill use master or whatever latest commit it's then
is it really that outdated
because they don't want to admit the problem
this is what you get when you want to be backwards compatible all the way to ms-dos
it depends on firmware but we don't talk about that
that's a few weeks ago
without every possible visual studio
can clang compile that stuff
ive seen this before
definitely won't work when your environment sizeof(int) is 2
in one package
it's not like it's 70 packages
there is a .0
it's not like it will have some many dependency that people will call it virus
why not use the one in the bootstrap
the apis are not the same
weak linking both linraries is pretty much it
or weak link both libraries
worst case is just make two versions of zebra
not apt
that should be fine though
also sha1
generating stuff apt 1.8 can't understand
you sure that won't cause issues?
must have some if version then
there are some api breakages i think
but it's libapt-pkg6.0
or stock checkra1n
so it won't support u0
are you using libapt-pkg5.0
zebra 1 still has dependency issues i think
don't get banned again and be safe
same as zoom
memory leak is a major issue
runs extremely outdated linux
anyways
i have a 16 mb ram device with over a year uptime
guessed it
what kind of device
touch grass
personal preferences
why should i
it's consuming 4 gb ram after opening it for 5 weeks
there has to be a memory leak in discord
should i run a signing service then
how does a 15 year old runs a signing service
rip icraze then
icrazy
please no eta
ok nje2mdq4otawmteyota4mzaw
where
i give 20%  chance for this to be right
your token. startswith ndixmtawmtqwodi1mjgwntez
prove it
harmony?
unreal!
hi nathan 2
people
never
why does it looks like  saunders video titles
i remember that ad lol
by replaying the signatures
it's not it's just 7f1efc24f5516d36589fb0595a9c9167e2678c6ed0e8e5aa9f301f1e9329ccba
we did not mention any itunes rip offs
are there any other bootstrap
telesphoreo, electra, chimera, procursus, elucubratus
except pwn
no one knows
and i know of a grand total of 1 bootstrap that does it
unless that bootstrap comes with daemons of course
it's just static files
bootstrap doesn't really affect stability
you can't jailbreak
odysseyra1n
of all modern jbs
checkra1n with odysseyra1n has greatest stability
why not 4039
so maybe
it is neither tethered to apple servers or a pc
in the most technical definitions
i mean
that determine whether a jailbreak is good
but please remember there are 100000 variables
untether in itself is good
where
he never did
pwn did not say it is untethered
device jailbreaks itself every boot without user interaction, and does not need resign
that doesn't mean there isn't any other working bypasses
there
must be detection
oh no
you can bypass it, but they may not work if it is actually incompatible or there is a manual check
i think
p0laris
not powershell on macos or linux
and i supoose by powershell you mean windows powershell
you need to open a terminal in environment that has checkra1n included
that moment when ios grows 1 gb for every major release
you are
it is
or just snappy -o
which ipad pro
that's what i mean
all procursus source files are 0bsd licensed
~~maybe they make their own procursus clone~~
so idk what will happen then
well that micrale isn't happening for ios 15
that's a micrale it works at all
using ios 11 bootstrap on ios 14.8.1
it's fine for it to be built from  the same tree but it should be two different ipas
which is both good and bad at the same time
at least it only have one bootstrap
which does not support your device version cumbo
that's like in u0 4.3.1
u0 used to have builtin rootless
(yes that was a real option)
it was fine when u0 had ssh only + read-only  rootfs option though
man really thinks broken dpkg is not a problem
this is the case since day 1
second is maybe
first is never happening
nick chan's messages
if you really want jailbreak
your best bet is to buy an iphone 7
wait 200 years
then you better stay on that version
jailbreak apps expire
this is entirely expected
id say pattern-f's pre-jailbreak has a better implementation of it
due to its nature
the fugu14 is either doesn't work at all or 100% success rate
cicuta_virosa
ive seen it before
cicuta *can* fail
~~so you do it too?~~
logic bug moment
100% success rate
base fugu14 is more reliable
99 usd to apple per year
i think
you can refresh every 365 days
if you pay a certain amount
i have over a half year uptime now
just don't let the phone die or reboot
you can have jailbreak while the app expired for 180 days
the app does
jailbreak does not expire every 7 days
for anything major that i use
discord has like the worst uptime
`188 days 2 hours 22 minutes`
better have better uptime though because chimera has bad success rate on 12.{4..5}.x
*can't open the app when non-jailbreak
not flower 6999
where's flower 1116
im trying to make sense of it
man im writing absolutely terrible c code
when will apple add recoveryos to tv 4k and homepod
checkm8 is about a use-after-free in a5-a13 and various memory leaks from a5-a11
how do you know how big your dfu payload's gonna be
the pdf link
it's on checkra1n faq
that should be much easier to read
oneweirdtrick.pdf
grapheneos
for other devices the memory leak must be specifically done
on a8-a9 there's a bug in dfu such that a memory leak will automatically happen when you try to abuse the use after free
so you need a memory leak to shift the allocation around
as you are just writing to the same place
so it can't be exploited at all
a use after free but normally the uafed memory will just allocates over itself
it is the "restore watchos with iphone" os
ima ask on hack different
smaller than bridgeos dyld_shared_cache
it has the smallest dyld shared cache i have seen
that's just nick-pc
it's apfs
it is the smaller non-asn.1-encoded  dmg
they can be found on watchos ipsws
watchos recoveryos
what is a
and xnu 8020
i think
that has kpp and all that stuff
there are 32 bit devices
jailberaks.app is losing $$$
so to reach that in dfu on a13 you still have to do that 4 billion times thing
so no
to exploit it you need to somehow be able to write to the nor flash in the first place
to use it
(aka you need to dfu loop your device first)
then device goes into dfu
but it can only be reached before dfu by erroring out when trying to read an specifically-crafted invalid img4 from the nor in a normal boot
besides the dfu 4 billions times one
there's actually another mem leak on a13
and apple obviously won't give out non-production signatures
because uid changes when you demote
so it can't work there
a10 exploit requires valid sep firmware
in pongoos
there is an open source implementation
on a8x-a9x
i think
you can do that with blackbird
because cpfm:02 is dumb
so there's only cpfm:00 cpfm:01 and cpfm:03 in reality
just in theory
so i said does not exist
you can debug sep but not ap
so you get
and sep can change the first bit
ap can change the second bit
wrong
demotion is the term used to refer to changing a device's effective fuse status to enable debugging of the ap and sep. the effective fuse status register will accept writes (assuming it hasn't been locked) to change the effective fuse status. for example, a production, secure fused device can be demoted to development and insecure by changing the effective fuse status register. ap can only change production mode, and sep can only change secure mode. by default, this is only done when dpro and dsec are present in the apticket.
it's about writing to some registers
the kernel has boot args
iboot does not either
bootrom does not have boot args
nick chan's english
nick chan exposed
there you can have all of it
im talking about those
wen eta
apple has them
guess
s5l8747 moment
i asked for s5l8747x support
already
i can memorize the link
what is a frasier
which is not possible if sentences are split like
that's going to result in awkward translations
that moment when sentences are split in the crowdin
that surely will be fun
huh translate 30k words
where
im just saying that the guide isn't accessible enough
nevermind
but uh
school moment
so it is not that questionable
a lot of people is actually on that setup tho
most people that uses these cpus wouldn't be able to use discord
16 nm moment
`zhaoxin kx-6640ma ` specifically
that's x86_64
checkra1n will work on zhaoxin cpus will it?
wait long enough
15.4.1 can be restored in itunes, ~~idevicerestore~~ or finder
you need a way to set nonce
because aes is symmetric
apple secure boot - root ca
aes is
i'm thinking about shor's algorithm
fr tho
wait 200 years until rsa is broken
is ios 4.2.5 jb coming
buy another device
it's not turning off
that's the problem
there are issues with it even after amfid is supposely pwned so no
pov: nick chan also be like that 6 years ago
or survey, "human verification"
it's a webclip
ballsos
and new verification method
technology do not stale like that
the rom also initialize hardware and loads the next-stage software from usb or storage  so you cannot remove it
you get an ibrick
the signature is device-specific
there are no ios 15 jailbreaks
rom does not communicate with apple
on a12+ some device specific value is entangled to the nonce so it makes it more complicated
how about entangled_nonce
updates are verified by software
wen signing party
pp battery
please note that there is no ios 15 jailbreaks
or rather hardcoded offsets moment
no offsets moment
a12 14.4 beta 1 is still unjailbreakable
phone is not plugged in properly
just violating an eula
it could work on plain checkra1n
but i can tell you that \*something\* happened
also please no eta
giveaway sponsor
easiest way to get cool fast is
no that's isn't cool enough
even if it's an uninhabitable island
just because these names are quiet common
cuz there is no whois protection
and apt.procurs.us is registered for someone in cumming
there is a city named cumming
for another ipa
speaking about ipas
there's ipa there
discord ios is react native
wouldn't discord ipa be piracy
i saw it
sideload altstore beta
tons in fact
it does
watchos users be crying
ios 4.2.5
or more than 4000 days for iphone 4 cdma
i think
we are already over 365 days for 14.6b2 iphone 12
although it will break your ears+speakers if you play it for too long
it does work
very funny music!
vlc can play anything
no, i think it's like alexk is probably just angry for a moment
maybe it's not deleted in time?
because i think alexk won't do anything
a server can have no channels
but honestly i would prefer alexk be unbanned
wouldn't it be rules
using jailbreakbot
delete every channel except rules and tvos
idk if they have same codebase
which itself is before gir
bot before janet
when  unban alexk
alexk warned aaron
remember
jailbreakbot
by jailbreakbot
when every channel is deleted
so the protection does nothing except annoy users
and a discord search for the user id can rip it out
either way
which is idk why
minutes
hours
homework is hard i guess
then why are you sending messages on discord
what is crunch work
go to sleep
signed rootfs is like the least of concern
which means there are some bad repos
also there are warnings about missing package: headers
i have no idea
how do i even use dpkg --set-selections
sileo
this is a very bad idea unless only updates from bootstrap repo is allowed
looks like hacker and developer packages are hidden
mind you
this is impossible
uh the unc0ver ipa already has more than 10 packages
i have 774 packages installed
because we don't know either
stop asking
imagine they completely disallowed exec in writable paths and every appstore app has to be a dmg
still better than iphone 4 cdma on ios 4.2.5
const long double son = inf;
checkra1n is dead
xf86-video-iomobileframebuffer
sdl2 is linked to uikit
wait a moment
let me see what happens with uiopen then
well, sdl2 which uses x
that's an x application
and actually uses these symbols
that is
after i gave it the fonts that it want
exit 0 now
probably something like that lol
instead now
it probably tried to create processes
it does seem like an entitlement problem
and see what happens
but i will try to resign it with normal entitlements first
it must be sandboxed for jit work
because it is technically sandboxed
it cannot spawn any processes
wait a moment
and extract it on the ipad
still same error even if i rip a user data directory from a linux pc
(dynamic-codesigning does not work when unsandboxed)
and i'm quite sure the entitlements are right
not jailbreak
and compiled minetest refuses to work
this is ios
any idea why this is happening (this is an ios executable)
my nickname is technically a hoist
and i use dpkg-divert and these things does not seem to handle it at all
these things is a bad idea anyway
it would still break my setup because i have custom packages that depends on bootstrap packages
i know iamlazy will certainly break my setup because i have like 400 bootstrap packages installed
enjoy your broken jailbreak
there are issues even after amfid is supposedly pwned
better export the repo list as well
and 15.x obviously
your mother
nothing can actually remove icloud lock,except apple
maybe it's encrypted
it in fact is broken
that's the question
when will my new macbook pro show up
debian makes security patches
which itself is quite old even when latest
but at least we know u0 servers runs on an outdated version of debian stable
public key only
it does
it is unc0ver.dev but with a ssh server
the unc0ver logo is just u0 with a font on
especially springboard
that's added in like ios 14 or something
this can't be done accidentally
to do that you would need to write in the context of a process that has com.apple.private.vfs.allow-low-space-writes
yeah we shouldn't help with it
should we filter appsync unified?
appsync unified moment
we probably shouldn't help with those but i don't think these should be filtered
then?
cheating is not piracy
why should it be
ive seen outright piracy repos in gir before
so i guess yes
because betas
with checkra1n it's like -30 days for some versions
ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 cdma moment
usually
there it is
the use altstore
taurine i think
(all devices)
rip bridgeos
ipad mini 4
i have a9x ipad on 14.3, it's pretty good
a8 isn't eol either
imo iphone 7 is good
so no replacement
procursus uses child labor (real)
why is hayden's pateron still here
without any partition table at all
alao idk rather ios likes usb drives that has a whole-drive filesystem
like hfs plus
it should have a supported filesystem as well
plus i think apple lifted the paywalls now
that's only ipod i think
app store moment
iphone os 2 is big
how to make your tweets popular: exploit eta kids
they also want jailbreak (?)
what is the old pfp
it works
u mean windows pc?
why is windows needed
there is lowerinstall so yes but whether it will launch is another thing
moment
cs i think
and c is hard af
i think
eventually it will
apple moment
firefox esr better
unless apple broke updates
system-cmds does not have nano
way more stuff than your average system-cmds
i have one that contains 56 bins
tss dead?
the system-cmds on repo just contains too few stuff
nevermind
study now
very real
im going to genius bar
it's basically just "how to normally send more messages"
the messages
it will look completely normal
by losing brain cells in genius bar or what
how do i farm xp
we don't need altjit to use altstore
(im expecting this to be filtered as well soonish)
altjit
same reason
it's like you aren't allowed to repupload ipsws
it's not
im learning c
enough procursus for today
seems possible
im just waiting for "altstore" to get filtered at this point
pirated dmg moment
it is
like gputrace
mind you
the dmg contains copyrighted bins
and im talking about developerdisks not discord invites
i think only one of them is filtered
there are two links
in here
or something
i think the developerdisks link is filtered
i have this link
that just shows every link in the cdn that is not a versioned ipa
i mean i did  have a urls.txt
they will hate me
wait i can
2. i can't crate invites
1. they have a bot that auto-kicks people
the lowest tier won't work
for discord
you have to pay $5 usd
actually
how much is 3 usd in aud
please don't hate me if i get red name
pay $3 a month
that's over a year ago tho
cuz im the only real mod for like 6 months
i don't even test anything
hey at least i got to be in the altstore pateron discord for free!
except that it uses stuff under gpl and snes9x license at the same time
it's hell
trust me i tried very hard to make delta ci
where
this is right in the source code
although altserver ci is hell to make
if you really wanted it
wdym you can just make a ci
it's not that hard
why not just jailbreak at an internet cafe or something
deez nuts
deez nuts
it's in the name of the rootfs dmg
pretty sure studio display firmware is darwinos
in surveys
pretty sure they just fill in dummy data
and i don't want to do that
im a linux user too
but it requires like 100 mb of free space on efi
figured how to do that a while ago
why not write linux files to efi then set bootnext
why usb stick though
don't think so
hello
libhooker has odyssey icon?
unreal!
iphone 12 is a14
use the u0 ipa
it is
happens on darwin-amd64 as well
and i made sure i didn't mess up the package name
it's 100% public
im telling you that you can find my email in my commits
sounds ok to me
i think the control is malformed in some way
and no that warning in sudo apt update
there are no duplicates
and util-linux is super annoying because it is split into multiple packages
looks ok to me
but we are dealing with debs
sounds kinda dangerous
works fine
warning
does someone know what this means:
although 2.38 is already easier than 2.37
why must util-linux be so complicated
sileo #trusted-archive was kinda nice ngl
nfts are ded anyways
we need #mempro-jailbreak
and even whitename v3 is not a given
there's 1% chance for any non-orange whitename and whitename v2 to figure that out
messing with apt pinning i mean
but that's too complicated
dropping jb out of nowhere = eta kids are an non-issue
u0 these days likes to drop jb out of nowhere
i think
they will
checkra1n 0.12.4 is borked even on 14.3 a9x
how can it be broken for so long
that's actually funny
for a9x **and a8x**
it is hilarious that my a9x iso is still needed
does sh0wer work
not that it's a good license
"genshin jailbreak bypass"
exactly same meaning
that's the same as the english name
or is it
...which is totally allowed?
and so many stuff depends on it
why must gettext take an eternity to compile
rip stkc
multiple choices
stkc is gone
based
and java
iboot string changed
there is no way it worked on 15.0b1
did not fix what it is supposed to fix
and this update is still broken
cope with it
aka don't substitute with pronouns
my libpronouns::pronouns::default is set to libpronouns::pronouns::name_passthrough
and not anywhere else
because i think the uafed pointer just points back to what it is supposed to point to
it has to do something unexpected at the first least
how is it an exploit
you still can't do what you aren't supposed to do with it
an unexploitable vulnerability  as of right now
that's a vulnerability
jailbreaks are too hard to make
come on
almost everyone does not
i think it is
still easier than finding a bootrom exploit
so they aren't frequently released
jus generally t not useful aside from stealing info
comsidering the userland is way bigger than the kernel
i can't think of a very good reason
i still can't imagine why people acts like userland exploit are hard
if it just crashes the device, then it is pretty useless
it does not need to show you how it can be taken advantage of
no; not even
you need to identify the type of poc
found nathan 2 again
real!
so stuff like this happens
that's why slash commands are still broken
pretty sure it works on 10.3.4 as well
you aren't for real
idk why everyone said it is so difficult to compile
just built amyh3lix (debug)
only source code
nowhere
amyh3lix
watch a jailbreak drop out of nowhere

i think lzma, lz4 and zstd is pretty uncommon

how about xz

what even is this nonsense order of words
is more likely to work

wikipedia text moment
i touched grass 3 days ago
rank=131
the only real ios repo that use multiple components is procursus
although it has no ui to add in the the first place
cydia does
sileo does not support multiple components
there's a thing that cydia can do but sileo can't
mostly anyway
wheres rfr
is the reverse of frcoal wfr
ik about these
same goes for the haywire firmware
that's has no nand so doesn't count
darwinos
audioos, watchos, bridgeos, and maybe tvos
the only thing that still makes sense on 16 gb include:
u get like 2 gb of usable space
that moment when saily used 1700 procursus on 1600
deez nuts
ah yes
auto erect
won't recommend that
saily is abandonware
hello
that's a dependency resolution fail moment
oh no
(this is valid c code btw)
no it's
gm captinc
why uicache
respiring
:skull:
this sucks lol
no idea
`418` is `i'm a teapot`
why is that strange
you need to actually install the app first i think
actually
please don't force your opinion onto someone else
he is free to change it every day
42 years.
and we need much more reversing
basically we should have all the exploits but sep is a black box
or everything
nothing
we have all the exploits to set a sep nonce
wdym first one is more possible than later
which breaks passcode
and if sepos doesn't like the state it disables access to certain keys
which changes the state of the true random number generator
bootrom reads a value from sep's true random number generator if it is going into dfu (it does not on normal boot)
but basically
ok but basically
english
apple added a mitigation
it's something like this
panic(cpu x caller 0x1234567890abcdef sep panic...
who made that
if you do, your phone will reboot
not on a11 at least
32 bit 9.3.5
it is
then he logged cameren and haydens dm
i think you can still find his messages if you search for noncemanager in this discord
with nonce setter functions as well
paranmat token logger
com.paranmat.noncemanager_0.0.2_iphoneos-arm.deb
and rick but that didn't work
noncemanager.app
~~i use force-dfu pins to get into dfu~~
(context: control d signals end of file)
control d
ban evade some bit^d
ill send cameren a deb when he comes online
which serena
checkpa1n
id rather not annoy slim
!t fr
how did you still have less xp than me
based
a4 moment
how is these two facts related
it's a bit complicated... basically there are differences between uikittools and uikittools-ng
yours isn't forceful enough i think
`uicache -a -f -r` isn't that the actual force
don't repost
we know
where
in `18 minutes`
im about to change colour again
lillie's server got deleted long ago i think
then the inode numbers would be different
without quitting sileo
do it separately
no i mean like
everything that is bundled with macos
uh oh
igpu doesn't work
but igpu won't work
spoofing comet lake cpuid
just not a good idea
gen12 hackintosh can work tho
anywhere
ios 4.2.5 iphone 4 for sale
are there even
~~time to make a jailbreak tool for it myself~~
when a new ios 4.2.5 jelbrek comes out it will be in announcements right?
"sol"
what does that mean
screw it i'll just try to boot catalina first
got that mixed up with darwin kernel version
sorry i mean 12.3.1
you think i should try darwin 19.x?
macos 12.4
nope, they aren't mapped at all
realtek ethernet
haswell
and yes xhciportlimit is false
thanks
i use opencore install guide
i didn't
i also have a messed up hackintosh
then no reason to have a mac for the time being
hackintosh
segmentation fault
`0xb` is signal 11
time to post my twitter banner
debian stable stable
i mean
than ubuntu lts
pro tip: im more stable than lts
you are just statically more likely to break when you have tons of updates
updates = opportunities to mess up
in fact procursus is at a higher risk of breaking
because we are targeting one os version
it wouldn't
it's 4 months
more like
that's the current branch
nah, more like 1 year old
worth it 100%
im still trying to get member edition
downgrade attacks
that's just messed up
imagine blocking tls 1.0 without blocking plain http
firefox esr
i have to use firefox to look at it
i think
tls 1.0
nito.tv ssl expired
where is jtv then
real?
html 4 ?
sudo.ws
gpl virus except that only the owner has it
is like really bad
vim license
based
i mean right click
speak message does nothing
discord tts is borken
also one of the few public transport that can actually make money
mtr is decent
basically
everything mixed together
ye we get checkerboard roads
~~aka no design~~
how about hk city design
15.4 and 15.3.1 not compatible
unless buy another device
you don't
hold onto that version
plus 15.1 is good
you don't
please don't ask to ask
cameren is alive
having it in uicache -i would be nice
please note that data may also be stored in appgroup
idk then
yeah trying to figure that out in terminal is hell
welll yeah but it's a uuid
each game as its own sandbox
it's not stored in the imessage sandbox
since each imessage game is technically an app
they are stored like any other app i think
remember ios userspace is 100+ times fatter than the kernel
as kernel exploits
i don't think it's actually that hard
previously
it's probably more like it's useless other than malicious purposes so less releases
brickstate bypass
madgate
that's icloud lock class
security research
btw 8:01 in china is utc 00:01
wen eta
that's airpower
they can still use static apticket no?
it's pongoos
which is already open sourced
1 bit colour depth
not grayscale
black and white
cuz vt100 fixes the most stuff but also turns ui black and white (or black and green, in an actual vt100 terminal)
well vt100 is a little too much
100% fix for issues like this
term=vt100 checkra1n
checkra1n doesn't like usb stack on almost all android
which has even worse success rate
still better than trying to run checkra1n in termux
write protection screw
probably easiest of all
i don't see any other method
on 12.x chromeos
the only way out i see on chrome os
on 12.x
i guess the shortcut can work
this is what you mean
chromeos does, the trash linux container does not
nothing in that guide seem to prevent someone from just using -k
why would it not
grep the help message
so we can't just add -o because that would break older scp and we can't detect it either
from what i heard
i think it is iboot overwriting some payload
and -o is invalid option before 9.0
but scp has no version option
very surprising that a hack fix 14.5 before checkra1n supported it is still needed now
i mean that option in the iso
no device to test
pretty sure checkra1n (a9x) works on a8x
and it uses checkn1x_a9x_kerninfo_pongoos
last time i checked  it does not have to
a8x fail too!?
9% - that's the bad ones we are talking about - 3x% activity
90% - doesn't really do anything (competent or not doesn't matter)
last time i checked aaron is not an eta kid
i mean pretty much whitename-v3 whitename-v4 and whitename-v5
the conversation of this server a driven by a not very large group of people
or 1% but that's responsible for 60% of activity
more like 2%
this server isn't much better
like what's even going on
personally i can't understand a thing in vc even though i understand the english
then why exists at all here
but yes
you are just immersing yourself in toxin solution anyways
(unc0ver)
which never became a thing
shadowise rootfs
buy a new device
discord developers moment
name of emulator
(it's the name)
play!
a discord server
since when is pornhub a game
then we have plenty
you are asking for game emulators
i guess
emulate what?
hello
cydia supports multiple components
ipod linux?
efi usb device
waiting for 365 days uptime
finally! 180 days uptime
they break each other
it opens checkra1n
bad code
and the jailbreak can still be broken by apple in various ways
supposely yes but that's not happening
iomobileframebuffer
with xorg
because we did not figure out how to drive iomfb
everything needs to be recompiled
default repos should do for that
i suppose there is still no location faker that works on findmydeviced?
im still staring at opencore install guide aaa
need both
do you have filza installed?
it may or may not
wait what do you want to do in the first place
then enter, nothing will be displayed but it is reading the keys
alpine
press y then enter
then?
i have both 192.168.x and 10.0.x
not everyone uses that subnet
i think
we need to stop saying maintainer === author because it isn't
you can install ssh without having sftp
aka the one on the apt repo
3. use the dynamically linked build
the api does not recognize that app or there are no bypasses available.
should get blue role soon
tomorrow is my birthday
also we can we have private pc but not private chat
i want to
i will
join private vc soon
piracy
also the altstore dev disks json is now filtered i think
14.8=jailbreak your display
then why did you say 14.4
isn't it 14.6b1
which is from appleinternal
protip: it's true
right now
android actually
daliy reminder that bootrom is not part of ios
and no passcode
gaining control before ios is a thing then patching it is not hacking ios
e.g. we still haven't hacked a11 ios 14.4
there
troll
and if that happen it is usually dyld: library not loaded or dyld: symbol not found
else it will crash
lowerinstall exists, but it has to be actually compatible
`there are tweaks to get around artificial ios app limitations but if it is actually incompatible it will crash`
imagine having a db without le
for example darwin 9.0.0d1 is shipped in june 2007
(only applies to more recent versions)
so darwin 21 is released in 2021
darwin version = year
that's 0.10.1 + unplug no?
ios 15
deez nuts
hmm ok
guide 12 iphone jailbreak 14.5.1
guide 12 iphone jailbreak
trying to figure that out
what exactly are the trigger
if iphone 12 jb
if iphone jb
if jb
that can get real big
especially themes
not all packages are tweaks tho
probably not
ok nvm
use unc0ver
im not lying ive cheated using filza
maybe ok?
but ye you can only try 100000 times
that should work hmm
cuz that error looked like super old kernels as well
what is the kernel version
yes checkra1n hates the usb stack on raspi 3b
linux cli builds are 100% static
devhelper does static link that
it does not on ubuntu amd64 repo
they package it as devhelper in static build
which is not a problwm in dfu mode
because that just means that the already running ios refused ro connect
even if it says this error
put device into dfu
if dumb doesn't work
must use cli mode then
it's about ncurses files not existing
or method two
then try again
export term=dumb
after that it's pretty standard cross compiling
you need to merge qemu-t8030 and utm's fork of qemu together
but i can give hint
wait zoey exists again ok
booting ios on ios lmaooo
already did that a while ago
:man:
qemu-t8030 on ios
supported by linux mips64 since version 5.12
4 mb ram btw (can be expanded to 8 mb)
although i don't have that hardware
for that matter
why not nintendo 64
no branch prediction moment
also 486s are good, because they are immune to spectre or meltdown!
as soon as something else needs the cpu it would start to lag
can play wavs fine but instant shutter when ssh + play wav
not much stuff support 486 today
that's after stripping like 80% of stuff off
some custom build of alpine linux
linux 5.15
im still trying to install macos on my pc
deleted when i moved my partitions around
i don't use windows either
how to break out of prison pls?
every modern app jailbreaks do that to survive a userspace reboot anyways
due to page protection layer
or something
i believe you can't just overwrite your (effective) user id in the proc struct of kernel memory
plus root seal is 100% quality of life problems only
we don't have another unpatched exploit like that
don't understand what you mean
happened on 12.4 as well
that's apple patched then unpatched exploit moment
aka linking to pirated stuff
they are just having pointers to piracy
they aren't
then altstore is banned
it's completely unrelated
it's about altstore downloading rehosted xcode dmgs
it's not about that
but something about it is banned now i think
(this is altjit btw)
tons pirated dmg links
to be absolutely fair here it may not be immediately obvious what is an eta
omg i hate using discord on an 6 year old android
can't do anything at all yet
can't do anything at all yet
still need to fix my macos setup
so perhaps kicked everyone
can't find that server anywhere as well
what happened to that
iphone 4 (cdma)
remember there is no way to jailbreak ios 4.2.5
where is your discord server
actually even an windows computer store would work for that
and use the mac there to help sideload
just go to apple store
easiest
get a pc
but it's not important
well i mean it would clear all revoked certs
i don't think 5000 years are needed
1. delete said app
a12 ios 15.2+ is skull
yep it is
ios 14.3
18c66 is definitely
i think
hexedit
it's some modded u0
oh ok
some really dumb stuff
i forgot
is there an exploit that allows one to jailbreak the dcp or something
for cicuta
i think it has to create 16 million iosurfaceclient or something
you mean 15 minutes
that's faster isn't it
oob_events
but please hold onto that version
you don't
rick is online
skull
who even is superuser
cs probably meant to include that
technically it means t8103 won't be supported
unc0ver
works up to 0.10.1
1. download bootable linux
jailbreak is safe,but what you do after it is not necessarily safe
64  bit?
and i suppose x86_64 as well
and probably no other device to connect it to as well
he does not have pc
iphone os 3
jailbreakme
poc is not exploit
longer answer
it will get rejected by installd
i think you can't sideload ad hoc ipa
springboard.ipa
on springboard.app
hard reset it then
and let's not forget that 64 bit ios 8.4.1 cannot be jailbroken
but for others, it's l
for ios 8.0-8.1 you can use pangu8
we are outbid by 100:1 anyway
thats $686730
apple 9063
donate certs to icraze
image taking forever to send
but for real tho i like c more
jmp anyone
we use tweak.s
this is my current age anyways log10(100000000000000000)
less than 48 hours
birthday soon for me
moment
the verification transcations just won't show up in online banking
:trollfront:
debit card
weird in another way
still nothing like whitenames
mem plus is
mempro generally are nothing like whitenames
being an mempro is unbearable
apps?
just statically compile everything into one bin
rjb likes it
bloat over 20 mb depends any day
or something
...because it is split into 70 packages
that's why it is not happening
use yt-dlp and have people harness you and send you death threats because of 20 mb depends
option 2:
strings like music_offtopic
there a lot of underscores in youtube reborn still
mee6 xyz
time to update the repos
ye xyz domain is dead as well
i still have it from months ago
it was a thing but not now
just not "do"
well you did have it then i guess
lillie's beta repo
skill issue
lillie made it
youtube reborn v3 is good
wouldn't that be very insecure
with posready stuff
windows xp
shshdump?
wiped factroydata
hw problem
not that hard to find servers behind cloudflare
that's usually alias of ssh
ed25519 key fingerprint is sha256:agqpc0hd4pretjtqkt0v2hmloex4xw1l0ueh0qckdcw.
still good for debugging
so is the alpha , staging and alpha staging source
funnily enough
please note that there are no idevices with 4tb of storage.
which just tells altstore: hey my identifier is io.altstore.example!
and implemented in my altstore-beta poc apps.json
i figured out how to bypass it
paterons can still allow untrusted
did you use public version
i ripped that link straight out of altstore source code
in fact
i really love it when the altstore beta ipa is just a file named altstore-beta.ipa on a totally guessable path
the reverse
ios 14.2 is garbage
oldest that is supported on kernel.org is 4.9, but the cip project supports 4.4
4.19 is another still supported lts
and a mips device on 2.6.32
and a arm64 device on 3.18
i have pc on 5.10, not really that ridiculous
newest is 5.18 btw
uses linux 4.19
so it's like 2 version behind by ubuntu standards
you can get stuff like 2 weeks old there
quite-new-but-not-exactly-bleeding-edge is 12
debian has security team
probably patched
bleeding edge has no version
latest stable is 11 which itself is outdated
while checkra1n uses ubuntu
just from ssh server version
revealed that unc0ver servers runs on debian 10
which means that you can try to ssh
port 22 is open but not on unc0ver.dev
idk port 22 is open
that command does not output that
there are like 2 urls that i manually added
again deleted to not be a dick
its very simple don't think too complicated
(in terms of url)
almost
and you will find it
look at altstore source code
bascially io.altstore.example
that can be abused
there is a bug in this file
how about bypassing trusted sources
best described as this
sometimes yes sometimes no
inconsistently yes
this is fine
ill just leave this there
aka being a dick
without version number too
deleted cuz i don't want it to stay here
want to see one more thing
but then altjit is pretty replacable too
but tldr generally if something is important and not replacable than it gets allowed
*i mean it still is enforced just very inconsistent
another proof that rjb rule 3 is a joke
like gputrace
there are obviously copyrighted apple bins in there
so rule 3
altjit
it's all links to redistributed xcode developer dmgs
this is a questionable file hosted by altstore
i need an admin to rate this for rule 3
this is a thing
i still don't get how someone can design something like that
which is just plain dumb
regardless of ios version
and it downloads and extract everything
18 mb
why 3*14 mb file when you can have all 3 bootstraps in one file
is the worst way that it could be compressed
odysseyra1n most stable
still a bit borked
to be absolutely correct,
~~have member edition without having level 50~~
can i just
if they do it at all
almost no tweaks write to root during operation
tweaks generally expects the hooking library (and dyld) to find its dependencies, no?
errno 86
bad cpu type in executable
so no
i suppose it is armv7
that's
instead of a compatibility mode
although it applies static patches
rootlessjb ios 12 has such a patcher
this is certainly possible
it exists
discord classic moment
simplest poc is just dding into that device in ssh ramdisk and seeing the device panic
also patched in 15.5b2
so not going anywhere
but what i just described requires ridiculous prerequisites
c is hard
so you can write to regions that isn't actually that file and since it is ramdisk device this means writing to anywhere in memory
due to lack of out of bounds checks
why does people think that filling up the disk including the reserved space is a jailbreak
yeah, also have that
editing is somehow broken
what this is doing
the entitlements makes it quite obvious
not even an ios 15.0b1 jelbrek
ivkey moment
also i think pongoos has command to grab sep kbags on blackbird devices
rip there's a factory sep
can u decrypt the sep as well
troll
dm pls
what is havoc discord
function: turns all md0 checks into dd0 checks so the device does not think itself is restoring just because we are booting from ramdisk
all patches are static and mostly clean
checkra1n allows one to have really good uptime
actually 178 now
don't want to burn my 177 days uptime
i mean i can technically grab keys for ipad pro 9.7 but
well at least the internal ones
grab them for every file in it then
p0laris
spv jb is already done
delay ota
but pretty sure iboot ibss and ibecs are encrypted
wait those are unencrypted??
i don't see any internetui patches in that ota so probably no
checkm8 is a good thing
but for a11- we can use production devices so
and we don't have stolen dev devices to dump keys from
i think we need keys which we don't have
there is actually just one batterylow
wait nvm
yes that has a development version
a development battery low screen display by iboot
factorylogo is just a gear anyway
ibootim
you can get a development batterylow :fr:
and by that i actually mean everything
i said it has everything minus a internal ramdisk and rootfs
it's all messed up all internal stuff minus a internal ramdisk and rootfs
feel free to preview them using partialzipbrowser
both are fine
apple screwed up big time
like, every device has those top secret files in the ios 15.0b2 ota
iphone 6s plus n66ap
so that won't work
i think
well mismatching sep is ok but the sep must be not newer than the version you are trying to downgrade to
yeah forget about sep
wait ok
and so untethered delay downgrade (of course only work on a11-)
pretty sure that gives you a valid apticket if it's compatible
tether downgrade first then have a delay ota
would that work for downgrades
wait a moment
~~tether upgrade ios 14.8 then delayota~~
certianly lol unfortunately im not able to boot the development kernels
there is no way they don't know by now
yes they still host it
apple screwed up
diags + factory sep + development iboot, kernel, baseband and more for every device
ye, check out the ios 15 beta 2 otas in the iphone wiki
u can literally download a rather recent one right from apple
ios emulator on ios
ultimately cursed stuff
have already posted on twitter, probably good idea to post it again here:
a lot of time
the thing i have now is time so
it's borked
ok, time to fix my macos setup
used special examination arrangement (+25%) as well
yeah i took that one instead
hkdse moment
i took an exam perhaps 2 times worse
china, not mainland china
just significantly worse than what i think i will get
well by not ok i still think it will pass
well it's ok for the most part
speedrun
member edition
i really need to get
ok i didn't
i think
did i managed to miss people going from new to member edition
that i missed
man how much stuff
it's good for reporting the seller
there are plenty on ebay
in fact that would be illegal in some regions not to do it
and go to apple store
get the purchase proof
then?
but anyways
that is in libioreport
that's not iokit
specifically the return type of ioreportmergechannels
to figure out some types
involved using ghidra
power management
i have pmset
and ew i really need to get member edition soon
15.2 is hell hard
troll
i will probably be at here for a lot longer tomorrow
so like
and im not clearing out these 300 pings until tomorrow
tomorrow that is
well i still have 1 day of exam left
exactly
why is smokin mod now
i hope we don't have incompatible package systems on ios 15 though
to load actual webpages
but it isn't a good idea
http equiv moment
probably
html moment
and dies
efficiency go boom
apt.procurs.us dead
cuz appleinternal trips like 95% of jb detection
jb detection more like appleinternal detection
actually
cuz security wise non jb state is exactly the same as stock
it technically is false positive
im pretty sure apple said "filesystem contents outside the sandbox can no longer be used for validation" somewhere in some changelog
which is a mount point
so not exactly
any check that checks for tweak injection will not work after a reboot
snapchat moment
more descriptive name
jb detection more like ever jben detection
;keto keto keto
although stkc is now keto
it does
that moment when build-essential.mk still uses plistbuddy
;keto keto keto
when we have hungarian uikittools and manpages
no compression
where is uncompressed
then it would be xz and lz4
xz it is then
define "best"
lz4 is real fast
xz -9e is slow
xz is slow af
xz right?
apt 1.8 has
sorry didn't read
which is altstore discord but free
delta discord also works
i dont like altstore
on procursus
what sd
since it isn't happening anyways
what do you want me to do then
this is revoked not unsigned lol
no, this is not that
these work too
ez just use a proxy
who tf buys that
femto
not nano
like the actual pico
u can make the deb elsewhere
which will remove postrm
make a fake deb that has that name and install it
i mean like
there is
arm64 asm
xpc.s
i have rocketbootstrap on my system
so not that hard to change it all
changing theos will change almost every tweak
then stop using those, and remember
we use the preboot volume
cuz sandbox.kext sucks
for jailbreak files
when union mounts
which i know will not work but i want to see the error for myself
the point is to test kextunload
that's not the point
dyld moment
any newer depends on kmutil which is closed source
also kext_tools-623.120.1 is the last actually opensource version
they have tool-entitlements.plist files
i did
entitlements moment
i think 128.something is also local
everyone's ip is 255.255.255.255
say it is local ip?
what did you do
my ip is 192.168.0.101 hack me
kext_tools_util.c has #if !target_os_embedded
(except for the app content itself)
which means that they do consider ios in that
there's multiple target_os_iphone and embedded in kext-tools
on ios
that only runs when there is a connection
and sshd is a helper program
isn't launchd the actual server
wtf is with the ssh options
nice?
idk but do it like libiosexec
1 char shorter
illgeal instruction
im not sure which header to patch but include it in everything
they aren't the same
and why does people think that no tweaks at all and safe mode is the same
why not killall -4
`libiosshm.1.dylib`
but since a lot of stuff do not use shm, so weak linking
libiosexec moment
weak link everything to it
these should work
ok lemme try out some plist only kexts
works until it wants a closed source internal header
ibend
iphone 6
now bend a 6
bash: doregon: command not found
kextload bro
on procursus
we have pacman
how to use bash_5.1.8_iphonesimulator-amd64.deb then
just get a x86_64 image
unless it is alpine apk
how do i stop mixing up flower and stkc
`\\.\physicaldisk0` moment i dont really remember
add cameren to procursus
but pwsh is meh
wine internet explorer when
then you should use their friendlyname
is a thing in powershell
`get-physicaldisk`
admin
something like that
it is supposed to be able read that filesystem but does not like it being on the usb device
windows is just stupid
pretty sure it is
isn't a usb drive just some file at some very strange path on windows
that's the right one
iso needs to be written from the start of the usb drive without a other filesystem
cuz it doesn't need that
checkn1x has no block device driver
:frgay:
i mean write
u need to put the iso file at the start of the usb drive
but not run
and it just gives up for no reason when it's on a usb
because windows can read iso9660
windows is just stupid
lol what
welp im kicked from lillie's server again
i dont think v2 is broke
blurred tro moment
remember to save boobs!
trohd
youtube reborn best
on my device
i can confirm that pojavlauncher and clang consumes the most battery
in this scale
where's uikittools
man when will i make  a gir rce
is ew
pycord
people that jailbreaks and pays for winrar
it's a ~~40 day~~ free trial
filza is paid
i guess
unless you mount it
gdrive is dumb
sftp best
floppy
i have also seen "real table enthusiast"
toliet cat is flower and flower is toliet cat
deez nuts
for duplicate binpack mounts
after userspace reboot on checkra1n
finally get rid of duplicate mounts
for it
and there's no repo
sudo is broken
the thing with pac happened quicker
that we can write and app store apps could read and is not the app container
or something
both src and dest of bindfs needs to be ro
iphonesimulator-amd64
iphoneos-arm64
to give non-blacklisted apps some perms
we have pspawn-payload-stg2
we need to make it enoent instead of eperm
uid === 0 is nothing
this time we only need to umount preboot
button press for safe mode
which is supposely to be needed for (semi-)tethered and untethered
lh doesn't support safe boot either
abuse what
or we can hook libsystem
and break it for a while
can u just umount
how are we gonna block detection
u didnt heard of coolbooter did u?
because ktrr
we cant load custom os
cuz it isn't enforced properly
ssv exists since 14.2
how are userland untether gonna happen
that is is rootless
but c1 team decided to hide it
apfs hfs convert is good
the filesystem arrangements are always the same why would they  need fstab
probably got ifdef or something
i think
it still exists for macos
how come the pack function is not right below the comment
sourceforge
anyways
unionfs is gone in 21
procfsvirtscsihfs.dext
for linux
i have a check
oh that
what do i do when someone call me fake cameren
where
probably
told sonic
fcommon std c89 so
cuz hping3 already gave me a stroke
ill look at it
some fork ran by a procursus contributor
!repo procursus
actually
or something like that
base files just make it procursus os
ok imma make clean
it is merged
(yes thats an actual target)
t2 has apple logo????
should i clean that
the procursus folder
pretty sure it is 64 gb right now or something
idk it happens with  a few packages
on packing
still that stupid not a directory error
there's
building for macos on ios still build for ios
some even have something like command-not-found in which
well, which is inconsistent
`command -v` moment
and even dash support it
y would you spawn a new process when u can use shell builtin
cuz u0 isn't good
there's launchctl disable
disable
just use launchctl
in some way
or something like that
aka. implies they hosts tons of piracy stuff
i mean
need to those there
what did bingner do again
it could also be kernbypass so
kernbypass is amazing when it is compatible
also can't ios 12 use kernbypass?
vnodebypass breaks tweaks
did you restore rootfs?
in what way
use chimera
trolla
ah yes
remount cd
operation not supported by device
then delete it
troll
fakeroot su
that's supposed to happen
example?
(dyld insert libraries needed)
quite ugly has you can see
procursusos
nekodl
python3 gui
- stkc
how come is flower unmuted
ok but only rick cares
when accept
imagine bothering to set wallpaper in live cd
imagine using live + setting wallpaper
there
pp battery
cuz libhooker on checkra1n on elucubratus does work
that won't work
just conflict it with some bingner packages
nebulae
nebula
bfr libhooker is not on procursus
for (4) and (6) (download part only) that is
and i doubt that is even enforceable its own right if you can legally do something without the eula rights granted
just looked at libhooker eula it is not preventing commercial jailbreaks from downloading from the 1st party
ok, revert
there
and username limit
change name pls
everything is a unicode character
hello
will completely full storage bootloop
probably zip types
just delete the spotify posts that will never go away
but then i don't even use altstore
and im not a helper
i have free access
but then it is in a way that it still isn't completely impossible to guess
technically even the other betas are on the same cdn but they can't be derived from existing link + changing versuon number
idk but someone with identical pfp
macos
1.5b1 is on the cdn
just need to figure out that person
hm ok
but that was altserver
pretty sure over a year ago or something
us $?
when people get their free developer accounts banned
(doesn't mean that it is a good idea to do so)
hacking games aren't piracy
app open speed go brrr
launch app suspended, disconnect from internet, continue
how are people supposed to test offline functions
pretty much everything apt supports
that's like
that moment when a repo have
balls
snapd is squashfs
lz4 good if both servers and client internet is good
then use lz4
technically facebook
when eta
that's just jailbreakd
so that new process can spawn and tweaks can load
on a modern jailbreak
you need something to constantly do this
and in fact
terminal, package manager, tweaks, no resigning  of jailbreak binaries
allow you to have a 'normal' jailbreak
cuz the margins are nonexistent
but the form factor as a whole is not so much
because the screen is big
(not biggest screen)
as well as marking some segment of executable memory as signed
and giving yourself permissions
such as setting the boot nonce
(except checkra1n)
in particular, technically speaking a modern jailbreak never completes
a modern 100+ days weak jailbreak is very ugly on the backside
useless in changing version number but doing a bunch of other stuff is possible
easily
and then there's also pac which means that you can't swap pointers
the software would allow it but due to hardware protections mentioned above you can only write variable data
on a modern jailbreak
you can do that
and before that you need to be able to write to kernel memory
you need to defeat ktrr which is a feature of the memory controller hardware to set something read only such as kernel constant data and kernel code
because you don't
because that's `__data_const`
like you can't even change the version number
changing some variables isn't changing the kernel
so pretty much no
not `__text` or `__data_const`
you can patch __data
where coretrust doesn't exist
unless you are on ios 11
ok, procursus could work just not libhooker
and has a different abi the taurine jailbreakd
`substituted` is u0 jailbreakd
`substituted` is not part of substitute
explain
how are libhooker gonna work with substituted
ibridge t2
i did demo ibridge jailbroken with another demo mac
jailbreak store demo iphones with demo macs
which amd laptops usually do
on amd
but not via a seperate usb hub
usb controller is directly connected to cpu
it works when
christmas
from an attacker's perspective
so optimally it would go from a very short reply time at the start to like 60000 ms at the end
no, hping3 is literally dos tool
it's something
if you can make that server takes 60s to reply
or better 60000 ms
or something
no, with hping you would want to make it 10000ms
on procursus
someone requested ddos tools
out of a million packets
52.1 ms is max ping
so i need to test
also it's dos not ddos
cuz i compiled hping3 for ios
hping3 literally means = hyper ping 3
cuz the amount of packets
hping3
with hping3
sending an icmp packet every 40 microseconds on ios works
ok so
i wouldn't recommend using that on games tho
backrunner
it's just straight up blsck screen
unloading springboard is not like respring loop
`ping` doesn't have any special entitlements either
and i doubt 100% packet loss is working actually
doesn't work besides 127.0.0.1 as you can see
and it doesn't work besides 127.0.0.1
just testing hping3
don't ask
how would i test hping3
real!
no you are confusing with seposfun
just the ramdisk
someone booted ipados 13 ramdisk on iphone 6

well there's a poc that trigger the vulnerability
there's a vulnerability
oml i hate the discord ui
old discord moment
aka they got stalked
such as buying food in 7-11 at 12:00 am
what the person is doing at times
something like that
person doing x with y at z
it also included track records
and it is very difficult to make law for that cuz it could mean that reposting 'nick chan' get you in jail
ive seen doxxes that actually leaks private info tho
since it is just reposting
so laws are not very useful
even if it is very obscure
technically
cuz that's public
pov: that isn't leaking private info
which is just fine
that's like finding someone discord account
4th point is useless
who knows
no thanks
ratio
and no even with that information it is not enough
but then i tried to google my actual full real name with general location  before and
because i left out some words
nothing happened
don't mind me i just use my real name online

what happen when doregon panics
what is a kp
just keep ssh open
can't you just mount it again
talk to me
diff -urn doregon nickchan
unreal!
stkc moment
im outside
that won't mess up device
at end of clipboard
no, it's because you have a newline
already got tcl to compile
some hping3 depend
ez no bootloop
and no im not using that kernbypass 14 that only works with libkrw
the first half is just kernbypass
what if we just no such file or directory for everything outside sandbox
apple should just permission denied on everything they aren't supposed to know even if they don't exist
does whitename posting any link still get instantly muted by the broken filter
we need to deal with a sensible command line not a half-broken one
and stop using unc0ver
just rootfs
lz4 in apt repo is cool
i can't imagine supporting apt 0.7
we aren't supporting that
negative wp is sus
give -1000 warnpoints
apt-get -o acquire::allowinsecurerepositories=true update
you need to make a script the carefully remove and overwrite every file
there's another way
cuz ur apt is too old
stop using apt 1.8
jetsamctl priority still broke
(basically)
idk swift
sorry we only support apt 2.0+
that probably apt 1.8 moment
~~848159481255034891 for impersonation~~
idk yet
5 repos
ez just get away with
sbingner.gpg
lmao that repo
there's literally no filter
sideloadly
use check
way to disable ssv
then did you literally do that hard
or just pull the debs as far as keyring goes it is fine
technically you can rip the keys off
real!
when stkc repo
make a new one that is
use another apple id
balls
rather
actually not even mod abuse
~~hey mod abuse can be anything~~
technically doesn't matter
~~make stkc admin faster and vote for doregon~~
hello
which  makes it even more ridiculous
duy has developer role
and somehow
im a whitename++
although that bootstrap.tar tells a lot
didn't include cydia
turns out the trustcache isn't that big

just sucks
cmd is shell too
`tablesh`
i use trash
don't judge
i use bash

pretty sure you need special usb hw to do that
if the malicious usb applied voltage correctly device will instantly go into dfu mode
don't forget that exists
forcing dfu via lighting
apple_drivers.txt
darwin isos
they didn't since 2007
a hping3 depend
tcl is compiling
hopefully a 2008 configure won't hate me
hping3 has one depend not on procursus
there's a reason templates works
a lot of makefiles is just search and replace of each other

pretty sure the teamseas role did something
hey someone need to ping slim
ahr0chm6ly9legftcgxllmnvbs90zxn0cg==
listen to me
just get an admin to fr it
man really say whitename send link = raid
lmfaooooooo
send base64
what did the persons say
human abooz plz demot
griefpeer
aw man
ez just append some random text as html comments
explain
at that point you can have the entire vfs cached
1 tb ram
extreme vfs cache maybe
powervr moment
3:09 pm here
currently using the 3rd power bank
ill never leak stuff either
it has no download protection
didn't knoe it's that bad
oh nvm
unless hes on stock checkra1n
why use choicy as opposed to libhooker configurator or substitute settings
basically yt reborn reborn reborn
troll
so that he could rest
deez nuts
good that i have 3
man im using my second power bank
im not bitches
well im in a theme park
isn't it 10:32 pm
ok gn
u0 isn't untethered.
to be fair that could mean a few things but yall know which one im refering to
plz no warn thats a joke
inb4 he has that tool that is named after cydia and doesn't work on sileo
looks like a tweak issue
and the few weeks are still counting
checkra1n team didn't bother
it's just that
the checkra1n app actually have sileo icon
it does
"installing cydia from checkra1n app in odysseyra1n"
that's basically it
imagine mixing windows 7 and windows 10
not easily removable i mean
maybe hes on sileo for checkra1n
a7 moment
actually
it would also require a custom iboot
*at least*
well it's not possible , but lemme list what it would take
cuz it won't work either way
there's nothing to bypass
for crane
not taurine
and the strange thing is issues only occurs with odysseyra1n
crane has been causing issues for me
yes and i have minimalize ~~although i only use that for a few icons~~
dropbear
packages
much chiller than here
fruhh
14.3 just works
there's an untether exploit on ios 11
and you need internet connection
probably
and no resigning
thank god it isn't a crappy platform-application bypass
u0 isn't
fugu14 is real untether
it's a fake untether
where did jtv go
hey don't worry i won't use gnu craptotools in tweaks
well u said use substrate.h ill find that
sudo apt install theos
equivalent
ok where is patchmemory
technically
libhooker compat exists
+ don't want to bother testing u0 so id rather not bootloop people's devices
make it for myself
imagine having such thicc depends
just slap libhooker.h libhooker.tbd into project duh
oml i don't like theos
why did i keep asking for free stuff (and often end up keep getting it) even tho i don't really like asking for free stuff
trolla
lillie is typing
aemulo dummy
coolstar is hot
cydia is literally a site specific browser
b00tlu0p it is then
wait wrong url
click here
member pro
whitename++++
hes doing a little trolling
as well as the firmware package that's nothing as well
in itself
for example the essential package is nothing
or nothing
it doesn't
apple os
there's also rtkit
than bsd
mac os is more bloat
just have some components replaced
it's not really slimmed down
there's no public ios 15 jb in development
checkra1n
ibrickr
less complex than before
no hes gonna complain
yes install altstore with filza, refresh altstore to properly install another altstore then delete the filza installed altstore
install untethered
lmfao
wen eta eta?
!t eta
not to you
are you going to talk about blackbird
probably not
cuz you need to make the trustcache again
the result is installing anything is a pain
u0 has drm
basically linus henze's demo
all i did is extract procursus, sileo, and the fugu14 files into one directory, modify prep_bootstrap.sh a little bit, use xnu-qemu-arm64-tools to make the trustcache, tar the directory and throw the result and trustcache into fugu14
proof
trustcache replaced
youtube reborn reborn reborn soon
glucose jb wen
safari inspect element
that sucks anyways
got libelf.dylib from dtrace
cs isn't a fan of inserting numbers into names
break1ng is 7 characters
pwnage3
next one will be t1n
well it's not going to be another amino acid
i'll do it for free
springboard.ipa
launchctl unsetenv dyld_insert_libraries
how about choicy
substitutesettings.app is based
imagine not figuring out how to make a bot that replies 'this product includes software developed by the sileo team' on your tweets
which 5 px and such contrast will do
it just has to be somehow visible
someting like that
#222222 text over #000000 background
for mentioning
then again having a 5 px text at the bottom of the website will work too
and that's fine
don't mention it
and i don't think any jailbreak does mentions about stuff related to uikittools
just don't say a faster uicache or something
you can include bsd 4 bins with gpl stuff
just don't mention about uikittools in the jailbreak
bsd 4 is not that big of a problem
well nvm
be bothered to make a bootstrap
i cant see someone wanting more $ and $
what will u0 do
which is the last thing we want as we want to solve the fragmentation problem
using procursus may generate license problem due to uikittools-ng
~~although there's technically one thing that makes it illegal but let's ignore~~
licensing
well they main reason im really concerned about that it's just that it will affect bootstrap.tar.zst
uikittools's ldrestart and sbreload is under another license
uicache works on 14
dtrace is also cancer to compile
since the code will inevitably be replaced over time
if you look into my closed relicensing pr i did exactly that
yes just change it before the fix comes in
so we can use a less toxic license
no, delete all coolstar code first
by the amount of stuff added
it should be 3.0
with minimum brightless
my only jailbroken device is an a9x ipad plugged into a charger 95% of the time and is always in awake state
clang bro
tried overb0ard but that doesn't work
how to set process priority?
yeah that work
well, more like respring "nothing" because nothing is loading
and yes that's a respring loop but it is safe
hello
that completely disables cpu throttling
um not *thermal* throttling
is there a tool to disable throttling while device is sleeping
the only case im hostile is when im bouncing such hostility back
im not hostile to a lot of people
when xnu-development_7195.101.1_iphoneos-arm.deb
not sure but i think that chinese spyware has it
in some extremely long terms of service
pretty sure it states that it will collect that somewhere
why is dtrace cddl 1.0
probably
didn't i send you a bin earlier
taurine fully closed source is maintained decent amount of time after that as well
but using the bugs are 100% fine
you can't ship the txt file in anything, yes
u can't copyright a bug
dtrace
untether bug in a nutshell: there is no check in whether a particular file rename succeed
but it is possible for the bug to exist since ios 11
third party apps
and not exploitable on 11 and 12 for another reason: dyld closures are not available for
not exploitable as an untether because the filename changes each boot
that untether will never work on 13
and obviously not __text
not even __data_const
to those 100+ days weak jailbreaks that patches only kernel __data
in the system compared
due to less restrictions
well although tethered bootrom jailbreaks are sometimes better
untethered jailbreak best
or restore rootfs and reset all contents and settings
succession
"nvm"
it's mostly depends of depends  and recommends of depends of depends
actually it only has a few
i mean it's 75% admin abuse in the first case so
rootfs
well that could work
no actual admin i mean
no admin moment
tswaps is meh
isn't bridgeos 5 still signed
not there
some ancient bypass
delete that
iphuc or something
what's that tool the jailbreaks 1.0.1
!jb pwnagetool
!jb pwnage
!jb jailbreakme.com
that's a face reveal
flower's old pfp moment
rule 14 ~~although no one follows them~~
bootloop-me.mobileconfig
sauce code looks fine so just don't use any precompiled bins
the cli
won't work for 14
man said he could login
shshdump
dump onboard blob first
u want onboard blobs?
cuz debian is shipping an ancient version of that
unless you are using debian stable if it is on the repos you should get it from there
.net bindings
u don't need blob to compile irecovery
or untether_force_restore
no_untether
did you try irecovery
ipsw onboards
how fucked?
u just need to know where it is
i think i had issue with crane causing hangs until i deleted it
it is possible
libhooker
there's also thermalmonitord hang and panic i also experienced that once on checkra1n
or watchdogd hang whatever
no one has bsod problems in taurine 1.1.1
just no issue with that
bsod is still in taurine 1.1.1
!jb taurine
yeah it works on your machine
probably won't dfu loop tho
recovery loop is straight up always enter recovery loop
bootloop
recovery loop
it's not a crash it is an exit
uhh4k
gircock
congrats
u0 moment
where
it didn't crash it got killed:9'ed
dabezt#9688
cuz i tried 384 mb ram and it doesn't like that when you write on ramdisk
and extract there
onto the device
directly send them via ssh
don't write the decompression results onto the ramdisk
you can save a decent amount of space there
since the bootstraps are very similar
checkn1x is more memory intensive
it just won't detect
so i just give up checkn1x32
especially since i can't figure out usb on 32 bit
and libzip doesn't like 32 bit and big zips together we wasted quite some time on that
on pentium m ddr2 ram 256 mb
another one is just doing it because they can
but one of them got no other pc
they aren't
one person used a pentium m ddr2 ram 256 mb and another person used a   celeron m ddr2 ram 256 mb
i still see people jailbreaking with checkra1n using trash laptops
cuz if that works people could just copy odysseyn1x.iso to root of their c:\ drive and odysseyn1x can find that
and not the internal storage either
or when linux doesn't support  your usb mass storage device
unless you have 1 usb port or something
u don't need a blob to download an unsigned version and it is possible thst you cannot download versions even if you have the blob for it
ssdttime is good
but then no one cares unless you literally sells hackintoshs
also let's not ignore that this is bypassing don't steal mac os x.kext drm
that is
in some regions
you could say that downloading macos while violating the eula is piracy
took 5 hours for me
some machines are more complicated
only took 5 hours for efi
limux
no big deal make -j128
there's a link to odyssey somewhere in the debian wiki
how about debian wiki
where do i find an ios gperf
compiling on ios has much better success rate
mcafee is literal trash
imagine using altdaemon
and since it is unload not disable it is safe
more cpu time for clang
although that isn't necessarily bad
autocarrot
ive seen that 4 times in 4 projects
clip is ez tho
the only thing i could compile right now is deltacore
delta is literal cancer to compile
why does this look like elucubratus mixed with procursus
pretty sure sileo discord is also reliable
load pongoos with pongoos
rip apple logo
click bootloop
now of course bindfs is crap
that technically a folder too
~~mount_bindfs~~
no difference to end user when done properly
no difference
** it would depend on how fast the dns itself is but then every dns is subject to this kind of latency
name into an ip
it's literally an address book
you do realize traffic don't go through dns servers
balls
a runtime library
you don't
utc+11 moment
then u0 better than chimera
unless you are on a12 ios 12.1.3 to 12.4.1
chimera better than unc0ver
use chimera
checkra1n
11+ for 1.x
it's another frontend which means that they have the same packages and repos
frontend
cydia but better
sileo
when will debian ship ldid
obviously
at least when the u1 thing is not there
relocation tweak that also work with find my iphone
where can i find deceptionkit required for sileo
get to level 50
me trying to
how does that has to do with ios
yeah by modifying a string in pongoos
nitro moment
private or unavailable
in pongoterm
know what
get pongoterm
so i somehow fucked up the uptime and make it epoch
what is the date 18933 days ago
cuz they are split
id rather not hide them
don't think so
wait ill just ask sunchip for something
imagine not using iphoneos-arm64 deb arch
that's trivial to fix for jb devs however
u can't execute arbitrary bins without using a trustcache
and doesn't require resigning
wait actually
corellium detection eta wen
checkra1n patches mount() more iirc
cuz corellium doesn't use checkra1n
on checkra1n
instead of the mountpoint
it still panic
and ssh keys obviously
becoming localhost
and the hostname will be messed up
first filesystem will start being unmounted
i tried that accidentally
imagine using non-rootless on ios 15
make var read only
wouldn't it
the union mount makes it hard
ask an admin
iphoneos-arm64
apple logo gone f because i chainloaded pongoos with pongoos
panicked in panic()
double panic
an even clearer image
clearer image
it never was piracy in itself, however
** hosted
sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly
u do realize that tool never is piracy
sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly sideloadly
(u can use sideloadly to install jailbreak ipa first)
ez just jailbreak and install libswift
actually you can but need to be all static
how would you keep the jailbreak app signed
~~give me mod~~
plus it requires spawning a fake kernelmanagerd task
because it requires root and some driverkit fuckery
the kernel exploit cannot be exploited in a webkit context
are you dumb
lol ipad still rebooted even after mounting that in
as you can see the hostname is broken as well
nvm managed to mount it back
there
looks like it is
i hope this doesn't explode
at that point
and it just pull straight from ac
probably not
unless you are using nicd or something
and yes this is inside a github actions runner
altstore
can't you just do that with coreutils, bash, nano,unzip and dpkg-deb
binutils*
107 newly installed
that could happen when you have both procursus and elucubratus at the same time
ye you shouldn't
unreal!
iso 15.2 jailbreak no pc no human verification no survey
misty did it
there's technically an ios 14 kernbypass that works on u0
for jb
yeah that could worj
unless you do some checkra1n android mess then you don't
!t checkra1n
~~report it as a bug~~
you don't
there's also another guy that did checkra1n on his router
yes some people don't have problems in twrp
because that's linux
that's supported
additionally you can ask for help on checkra1n bugtracker
that's galaxy a12 right?
post the photo
pretty sure that has some dumb requirement of being pre signed or something
well you can also just drag an ipa into app library in itunes
pov: that isn't (quite) piracy
stickers are oversized emotes change my mind
we also have this
and yes that pinged
because ik that will ping
tesseract is going to release before mantiscam
very serious
not sure
cs has 3 twitters (technically 4 but that is abandoned)
in addition to cstar_ow
you didn't look at cstar_ad did you?
nah cs actually start wanting people to use 'she'
they just don't know
if it isn't
there's no way cs needs so much hair removal
pretty sure it is the case
that's quite good
at least people don't dm me
unless you have actual reason to don't
buy it
because they aren't symbolicated
because sometimes it doesn't work
!t eta
ok but the edit is just to correct grammar
that crashed bot before
reacts don't get logged i think
ratio
partially open source jailbreaks are fine i guess
!t taurine
especially when most stuff is still sandboxed
no pc should have apps
that doesn't make sense
no even for banking
untethered
for taurine
eventually tm
tesseract-bula
not just a binary
already have compiled an actual app without xcoce
do you need xcode to compile
~~although a lot of jailbreaks already pirate launchctl so not like that matters~~
they need to start pirating apple spotlight then
i want to mount orig-fs
crap i just accidentally ldid -s'd fileproviderctl
how does succession works on 16 gb devices
well it was working so i guess you can still rip it from there
for that
my actions are broken
press and hold works on newterm 3.0b1
well it isn't bad for you
uikittools-ng 2.1 soon
pasting
rick is just being rick
now call your crush
real!
got new best friend?
king?
bro i installed windows xp for this
that's for translating the actual text the programs prints out
6 is games
speaking of that
i think i have pojavlauncher(6) somewhere
still figuring out the logistics of adding locales to uikittools-ng
when it uses the gps
no i mean
there's no location spoofer that works on fmi for some reason
but then 14.6b1 is just 14.6
it should be 14.6b1 shouldn't it
libintl is in uikittools-ng now
i hate bloo
uptime doesn't mean anything
thats a9
look at these undead processes
sounds legit
launchctl reboot userspace
nick chan moment
dropbear
and makefile does not have 1400 either
ok where's the 1400 repo
oldcursus has 11???
ios 11
then it will be permanently fixed
yes that could be fixed by jailbreaking with checkra1n and creating an orig-fs snapshot then press restore system in checkra1n app
and face id
also rip rootfs snapshot
there's sep
if a repo can't `apt update` smoothly on apt 2.3.7 it's not good.
doesn't make it immediately good
don't export tfp0 and that doesn't work on 14 anyways
pwn said fugu14 support, didn't said untethered support
this isn't expressed very clearly
because
u0 is not untethered
yes that is untethered
unc0ver isn't
fugu14 is
because it isn't untethered
well,
well i have an iphone 6 that's discharged for 2 years and wouldn't turn on after plugged in for 14 days
mv bloo gir
which isn't a bootloop
because it's also possible to recovery loop
ratio
wholesome
just not on windows host because the host os needs to be able to do it
it's possible
and people made checkra1n macos to work on linux macos vm before
** if the vm software and the os knows how to improperly send a usb packet it will work
id rather not have this person bootloop their device
balls
where a thing becomes free
pretty sure similar stuff have caused lawsuits before
packix
minimalize on
pirate.ipa
gotcha
already did
checkra1n on samsung smart fridge eta wen
not every device that can run checkra1n is pc  but meh
you don't
there's literally no way to distinguish so
inject into doregon
well i mean he made an alt to speak in every server
can you modify it
shm moment
and i think u said ios 5 has issues
ios 6?
what is that compiled for
balls
that moment when iphone os 1 has no real secure boot, no codesigning, everything run as root and no sandbox
well that's iphone os 1.1.3 i think
iphone 2g moment
too early
pretty sure cam isn't looking at us yet
aaron
system info
and yes that's an a9x ipad
that boxed $1680 makes sense
that unboxed one should be $90 or something
ok that's ridiculous
people buy those just to collect them
cuz iphone 1 is a collectable
for a reason
i said it is expensive
but iphone 4 best bet
ok that's much lower
iphone 1 is quite expensive
no that's slightly more expensive
lmfao
gir will freak out
ez just send a message 4000 long
actually recovery loop but meh
for someone that needs to be assisted like that for a xcode-select
bootloop eta son
that is
do what it suggests
aight
move it
actually
install xcode
there's a lot of stuff in darling that we could use
but i have the sauce and bin
gotta update pongoterm i think that fixes issues with uploading bigger files
do it
just got another unreviewable pr merged into uikitoools-ng
syslogd moment
when nonsense like this appears
that moment when i brought like 7 * 3000 mah power banks
when can we do a dash moment 2
ill ask lillie later
format fail
and dynastic wouldn't do it
opa334 and 1conan
libstitute and subhooker
cylio and sidea
not arm64e
arm64
there
for tweaks
icleaner rename stuff to something.dylib.disabled
but yes
it renames daemons
except clemmed user these are usually bot stupid
people still think saurik scammed them when they pay for cydia cloud or something
don't ask why i have them
that's a thing
launchctl disable
disabling daemons are (almost) always never good and even then icleaner does it incorrectly
aka: everything is bad if the user is dumb
unless you mess with uefi
default checkra1n is unra1n
nothingc0ver
ios 11 is the worst
5s only has 2 threads anyway
but performance will die on iphone 12
5s is fine
actually
especially on a 5s
say bye to performance
when the procur is sus
it could also be that it is emitting unsupported instructions
com.apple.webkit.webcontent
libraries and frameworks don't have entitlements
from siguza's description
don't mind me im pretty sure c1 binpack is worse
~~its rigged~~
altbackup.ipa
(just to look at them)
you can be in piracy server without pirating
that suggest otherwise
you clearly didn't
change bundle id
and very hard to submit good bug reports
just figure out what instrucuins to modify in aemulo
change bundle id
ip address doesn't look like this
cuz with what exploit out there it should be possible to make tool to set that
sep nonce
no one made tool to set nonce yet
what device lol
build.yml
don't think so
i don't
ios 12 probably dead for good
so that's more for refresh without pc jailed
for the pairing file
nvm you still need a pc
when tag for altserverupnp
which can be run in ish
wait i think it's altserverupnp from altserver-linux
i think that's upnp stuff
think somone did that
literally just wifi no pc
no i mean like
pretty sure there's a way to sideload with just wifi i think
just trying to prove a point
no redsn0w doesn't work on that
how jb iphone 4 cdma ios 4.2.5
14.8 more likely
also that's iphone os 1
1.14.8 doesn't exist
am i jb enthusiast
cuz i can read that
real?
it's m1sta's url
there
plus many people recovery looped
or what?
lost  a bet?
deez nuts
each time a new feature is introduced bugs are potentially introduced
and im pretty sure that leaking 1 bit isn't quite enough
actually 1 bit
to leak 1 byte of memory
u do realize that will take many months
as it has no space to write them and result in a out of bounds write
technically we have  a memory leak on a13 in the boot selector due to the lack of an overflow check
** memory leak
and since it is still the same memory you cannot abuse it there
it's just that the the same memroy would allocate over the location the uafed pointer points to with no way to shift it on a12 and a13
!t eta
the vulnerability is patched after the a13 bootrom is finalized at around the time of late ios 11-ios 12 betas
probably up until 11
and that's where researchers found the patch first
also iboot
checkm8 is an iboot exploit.
4.2.0 uses substitute which is actually hot garbage
up until 4.1.1
actually
i mean up until 3.8 it's probably fine
3.3.0 only supports up to 12.2
anyways
for 3.3.0
so i said it's better than 1.4 but worse than 1.5
chimera 1.5+ has libhooker + procursus
!t eta
evem that could result in a recovery loop
eh u0 is better than chimera 1.4 but not 1.5 and above
(that's a problem of all jailbreaks at the time, however)
and exploit sucks hell on 2.x
in particular it should be a version  that does not use substitute yet
that actually good
unless you are using like u0 3.3.0 on ios 11
fugu14 is more than exploit
you can spawn bash and run arbitrary binaries with custom trustcache
it basically is
(you need another exploit to install the fugu14 stage 2 app which is actually spotlight)
there's also ad-hoc bypass
2 seconds
click it
click it
!t eta
recovery mode loops
chromium os u mean?
not even apple logo
a lot of them are outright recovery loops
recovery loops
yeah fr
some of them go to geo actually
moment
anbox is a container
you use macos dmg files with darling-dmg and apfs-fuse
man wants darwin-i386
pov: darling curl is broken
neofetch says dpkg for a reason
but yes you can execute linux bins inside of that
and it requires a kernel module
hello world gui works last time i checked
need linux
guru be like
it's some cursed xnu kernel compiled into a linux kernel module copuled with a userspace emulator
pov: it isn't
memory usage
doesn't close when your terminal closes for whatever reason
attach and detach
newterm is
tmux is not buggy
newterm doesn't lag with tmux but it is even more bugged with that
there seems to be buttons there
no visible buttons above virtual keyboard
no keys for me
now donate 0 days to coolstar
linus probably
now do the recovery
how about a9x
just use tethered
no i mean the fugu14 writeup
rip no untether for 13
there
!t taurine
i mean i kinda understand it but it's not simple
trying to understand what's going on
just wrapping my head around in the writeup isn't the easiest thing
then do the birthday command
unless you get some foreign payment methods
apple doesn't have itunes store in bangladesh so there's literally no way to pay
not bootloop
recovery loops, yea
it's face id firmware issue
welp searching "bangladesh itunes store" gives negative results
aight
ok so what is the country
but where is there?
he said no one sells them there
where
gift cards
hi hockey
especially you need to figure out the build commands on your own
hes not smart enough to figure that out
remove battery
unplug
interesting
how do you know
mega fail
the words are really hard to see
not wise if you have to ask this
read it again
should i install taurine
launchctl exists on macos so better not actually filter launchctl
why is launchctl piracy not punished
oh yeah that's crap
thor isn't filtered
get some sleep
~~jbupdate.trustcache~~ (won't work because libkernrw)
aight
thick?
or just use bootlu0p with fugu14
pretty sure you can make cydia work on fugu14
because some filename is randomized on each boot
no, not at all like it cannot be exploited in an untether on 13
13.5.1 has no untether
the second u0 app is probably spotlight or smth
connect an android to iphone and jailbreak
then bugs out dyld to do all that jailbreak stuff and show the ui
literally
fugu14 is spotlight
ok so fugu appearently uses some bug in driverkit as well
the writeup is really something
nvm i said something stupid
it is when compared to years
since when 9 weeks isn't a few weeks
id rather wait a few weeks for an untethered jailbreak that i waited for years
mantiscam
research and development
pwn has free corellium
but actually some of them are recovery looping
lmfao
but aight u0 + half baked jb is easiest way to become a disaster
don't enable the fast untether
so easily
fugu14 itself probably wouldn't bootloop
slow mode = bad
yeah there's definitely a 14.0-14.1 kernel exploit
there's one iirc
pretty sure 14.0-14.1 can use another kernel exploit instead of cicuta_virosa cicuta_virosa untether will suck anyways
pwn forgot about 14.6b1
at least the compile
not crying in a9x 14.3
because arm64
i literally can't install fugu14
people probably doing setenv boot-args untether_force_restore
im just going to go out of the way and try the compile fugu14 on linux
not an actual virus but not a false positive either
yes, vm works
pretty sure i did stuff like that before
can't you compile ios app on linux
probably tested once
fugu14 reads boot-args to give chance to delete or disable in case of bootloop
ok so appearently the untether reads boot-args
there's a script in xnu-qemu-arm64-tools that allows you to make your own trustcaches
skill level needed: ability to make scripts like odysseyra1n script
you can use it to install sileo + procursus
and that could be sileo
you need to generate trustcache for every binary you use
you can make it install
explain
tcp shell in 1337
hi nebula
am 3:00
welp october 25
found nice succession alternative
1st january 2121
~~new eta for untether~~
ratio
thermal
unrootless.kext
i can flex
just install sileo macos from procursus
!t untether
m1 or intel
sileo macos bad
ios 19.4
fruhh
chromebooks are useless
~~wen eta ios 15 checkra1n~~
that's just an adblocker
troll
mess with the write protect screw and put other linux on it
which is a memory muncher
it's really because of chrome
nah, that spec isn't *that* bad (still bad)
diskless workstation
they have 1024 ip addresses
public
my ip is 175.45.177.5 hack me
how would having a blob help you get the beta ota  firmware  file
id like to analyse
i think there's some interesting files in there
not install or anything else
that's installing it
not ipsw
and it must be ota
for ipad6,3
in particular i want ios 15 dev beta 2 ota zip
beta ota zips
not restore
i just want to download the actual file
and ipsw.dev don't have otas
ipsw.me don't have beta
where can i find downloads for ios beta otas
studying the ota updates in the first place because i think i might be able to find launchctl in them
i mean we also had hurricane eta in 2020 so
and no i did not use google because that often return bad results
heres a better graphic
this is a real graphic
i mean
i use discord btw
**e**ta so it doesn't have to be accurate
eta is not ta so
your time zone
call me nick unless n1ck disagrees
unless it's literally stupid or troll
doesn't care what you call me
package gnu binary utilities properly for ios
more like it scams the device
trying to stop binutils packages conflicting each other
yes but useless
but then since every binary needs a trustcache it's trash
i can probably figure out how to get sileo installed on that
probably
panic(cpu 0 caller 0xfffffff010f6eabc):  initproc exited -- exit reason namespace 2 subcode 0xb gotta love this
1800 is empty
aka 2100000 terabytes per second
2100 petabytes per second
flower.mk
only thing a normal-but-not-so-normal user to do with it is to set a nonce
send flower.ipa
somewhere in between
cs probably need to test it on every device
root-live-fs=1 moment
redacted
!t untether
~~gircock is slim approved~~
i have that as well
which server is gircock from
i saw that emote
nfrcock
gircock
there's only iphone os 1.0
bootlu0p
now gotta package which might take another 30 minutes
binutils pls finally compiled after 13 hours
whitename+
since 12 hours and 30 minutes ago
binutils still compiling
pov: one of these accounts is dabezt alt
in utc+8
untether dropping at 3 am the next day
ok lol
according to him
hes already in floor 3
october 25
technically
it's more than an exploit
and bootloops everyone
u0 untether will release quickly
apple plz dont go after me
ipad mini 4
pretend you didn't see anything
nothing
root-live-fs=1 says hello
!t untether
so actually audioos
homepod mini
found another ios 15 kernelcache with 900809 symbols
troll
45151 symbols
there's other compression modes
i don't think procursus has that
what region
2158 here
ok, compiling binutils with 98 targets for 3 hosts hopefully my pc doesn't explode
already knew it and not fixing that
cameren pop
can we have h pop
for testing stuff
because i want to access it remotely...?
allowemptypassword yes
there's a reason we hadn't brute forced apple secure boot ca private key yet
it wouldn't work for me cuz it's going to take forever to brute force public key only authentication
gl bruteforcing public key
you don't use http on 443
welp what does this mean
lol is that guy from utc+14
singular they is in dictionary so that's fine
or use it for everything
ez solution: don't use pronoun
i could see thay happening
ig it could happen
actually olds
00:17 utc+14 october 24
19:16 utc+8 october 23 here
utc+14 is reaching october 25 in less than 24 hours
he has 23.8 hours to release it so that no one complains
in 0-49.8 hours
~~linus releases untether at 23:59:59 utc-12 october 24~~
such as kiribati
for utc+14
today
24 october
ive seen mempro knowing nothing
no then
wen eta ipad 2 ios 4.3 jelbrek?
!t untether
!t eta
with an adapter
but you need to plug in an actual ethernet cable
pretty sure 6.1.3 has ethernet
dists and components
u forgot
ios has ethernet support since like ios 5 although there's no ui until ios 10.2
the package: field that is
but anyways `apt download package-name`
can't you just use usb ethernet
aka. cydia is completely broken regardless of everything else?
installing cydia in sileo still works last time i checked
onboardfrs
a lot of people save blobs but never use them that's fine
kvm pci usb controller passthrough checkra1n when
just finished with the uikittools-ng man pages
if it doesn't work with apt auth.conf then it's bad
to bypass the lock
just rip it from actions
github pages
that's why
unless they managed to be revoked in 3 hours
just downloaded from github actions
repo died
'iphone might have reduced performance during startup'
probably mean the untether code exec
so it doesn't include 15.0.2
also since 15.1b3 is older than 15.0.2
but we don't have that
if it can be exploited from sandbox
kernel exploit actually does
**vulnerability
there's no real technical reason you can't mod
not that you can't mod
there's just no mods
you can
when bootstrap_1700_rootless.tar.zst
don't think so
so many man pages
oml still need to localize uiopen.1
one more man page to go
uialert(1)
no, more like the `man` program does not have a chinese font
gotta love it when it does this
finished another man page
tsa is ez
gl bro less than 200 days until i take that damned public exam
it is wack because you are translating all the ideas on the fly
you are just speaking cantonese and write mandarin
nah, you can write cantonese
aka classical chinese
literary chinese is a bottomless hole
13:46 in the next day for me
13:46 afternoon
i at least learned 3 types of that to different extent lol
`yue`
actually even some of the types listed there aren't entirely internally intelligible
there's many different types since iso define it as whether it is mutually intelligible when spoken
well i write that but i speak something else
aka while that's correct you didn't get it accurate enough
accroding to iso 639-3 that's a macrolanguage
plz guess
same as your nickname but a different character set
first one is h'ss
inspect element
how do you bypass that ui limitation
although the invite link is technically there
by the discord ui
it should get omitted
how do you know that
or when apple unpatches a exploit
lol it doesn't work like that
protocol version ffs
not yet
and whether face id firmware is compatible
there also a thing called whether fdr is compatible
nfruhh
when he discovered that he has to insert a trustcache for every binary
if i can spawn a shell does that count
cuz i doubt it will work for me
am i an average user
that moment when i can't find an ios diskutil
yes that's a thing
nice ghost ping
some member edition here maintains it i think
that's good
so fake
woeis
wen eta cameren, cameren and cameren are typing
ok which cameren is this now
yes i don't normally
bootlu0p is coined in oct 9
bootlu0p
!t blobs
save boobs!
imagine messing with amfid without kernel rw
although that's more like security
there's discordsecuretoken
am i unfunny
however, when being unfunny usually people violate some other rules in here
at least technically
being unfunny in itself don't get you muted here
for cheating
why would you need that
cuz launchd needs a 32 bit slice for this to work
does launchd has a 32 bit slice
soon bro
you are looking the whole time
exactly what i thought
man 1 man
well, some of them are actually japanese characters but they are not being used as japanese characters
yeah those aren't japanese characters
those are hanzi not kanji
there are no japanese characters
in the screenshot
bruh the keyboard just wouldn't show
wrong ss
there appears to be buttons above the keyboard but i can't see it
out of spectrum:
this no refers to..?
not sure about 1.4.1
1.4 has that
odyssey recovery loops
just to be super sure does odyssey 1.4.1 has that recovery issue
not even the preferences ui work and saves stuff
all manticore does right now is to panic the device
imagine lol
mantiscam won't come out
so i used 'stuck'
i won't
he said he will do 3 git commands when he's on the 3rd floor
this is they 6th day he's 'stuck'
accroding to him
remember rpwnage still 'stuck' in the elevator
mantiscam
that's a vulnerability not an exploit lmao
kernel exploit patched somewhere between 14.6b1 and 14.6
that's a very serious vuln lol
it got patched
that ifttt link
that's just noncemanager
that allows one to grab token just by clicking link iirc
there was a vulnerability
in some servers
pretty sure nyu's dm is actually on
i don't get much spam
i think
my dms are turned on
unless that part needs extra patches
and hopefully qemu gtk as well
yeah but x86 is not absolutely required
to run arm64 apps
can't you run arm64 wine
u need to make llvm and ld64.lld work properly
that's the most cursed thing ever
got hello world to build for ios on windows
plus i don't believe gcc-darwin-arm64 fork is good enough
especially since we have fortran compiler now
he just doesn't bother
make it work on freebsd as well pls
noice
that moment when it has like no features
hdiutil moment
and yes that small text is log windowst
the only elements is a button and a log window
a log window with a button instead of white screen
not white screen
i have a better poc
i think i moved steam folder before
(unprivileged tho)
it's like trying to delete rootfs recursively
and deleted them
cuz it messed up my files
that's a big bruh moment
especially after it tried to delete my root filesystem
i really don't like steam
or at least tried to, that didn't end well
steam deleted my rootfs before
something something
don't mind me i try to use apt whenever i can
to get it added
edited the files
can't you just
unless it is like member no-life or something
anyways
member two sounds like a bad name
menber 96
only slim can actually do that
idk ask slim
member two wen
we need member two
you can just outright patch all the checks in kernel
why would need a jailbreakd
aight
pretty sure i posted binpack
can't you just use binpack.tar.zst and turn that into a  dmg
not talking to you
use a vpn forwarded over ssh
that makes it like that
what files did you modify
the last thing i want is making translation errors
which is what repro claims to support
even on ios 9
i'm quite sure that you can do it without external depends
how about sideloadly
sauce
i literally can't figure out how to compile altdaemon with swiftc that after staring at the sauce tree for 5 hours
not like altstore+altdaemon is any good either
moment
man thinks that would help
if it was rick it would be a ban
i can't
~~discord~~
tidal
what account?
im dumb
picture in picture
which wouldn't work because that's for t8030
checkra1n support every ios 14 versions lol unless you are talking  about a 2019 xnu_development build
cuz i always felt like he is watching all of us
is cameren lurking
it isn't actually surprivised
what change name
libfuck.1.dylib
hidden  requirement for dev role: you need to have sent at least 1 message here
give that man dev role
but still can't build librsvg because can't build depends of depends
because it isn't
of librsvg
yes that's a depend of depend
and no this isn't macos
fake tutorials
me on a detached head be like:
what files did you modify
why tethered
does it add some crazy env var or something
bro darwin 21.1.0 is ios 15.1
then library got populated with stuff again
immediately did mkdir library media
didn't bootloop
they are just unix commands
for darwin
big thanks to absidue because he wrote the entire backend backend
xbattbar
yes that exists
xbattbar?
x11 qt
is cameren really lurking tho
how many camerens are there
don't think it is open sauce
whatever
!t eta
and no injection
since every binary has to be trustcached
very bad
it's just
what fugu14 description describes is good enough to get sileo rootless up and running
and an (improper) amfid bypass
and that would apply to one region
or smth like that
unless we have a court ruling where someone got in jail because of a specific tweak
to be fair the whole thing piracy here is poorly defined
or isturbo, ispurchased, ispro usually they are these
thatd be making piracy and keeping it to yourself
like that
or something
cuz everything that do it is like ispremium
it's like
maybe
uicache(1)
in principle it isn't but like every tool that do it have other reasons that made it piracy
ok, 255.255.255.255 that is
and yes that's forwarded
i use ssh on port 2222
passwordauthentication no
no that's like usd $9000
nah checkra1n.com is expensive af
even for the scam site
looks like they still can't be random strings
people are acting like  having someone's ip can do anything
stemcommunity
discorcl
diiscord
with dyld_insert_libraries to sileo
cuz i already figured out how to use sileo's givemeroot to spawn a root shell from mobile
it's not like having a different password can do anything
that moment when you don't disable ota updates
that's totally fine
back in february
it is normal
especially when the person is good enough but then smart person don't do this
not saying that you should
that is possible
theres new vulnerabilities
so it's less sensitive
oh yeah that's a falsepostived filter
minimalize on
also no injection
you can't just run arbitrary bins without a bit of work
probably
it would be root user + ssh, rootless + all binaries would need to be trustcached
libhooker.h
just not the actual development files
i have the documentation
probably not because there appears to be libhooker specific api
or smth like that
where can i find libhooker.tbd, libhooker.h
i hope jtv is doing aight
imagine folding polypeptides
ok strapprojects that is
what ffh
chimera
up to 14.3
an everyone ping
then zoey got banned as well
i still got a ping stuck in trusted
what servers pwn is in
pwn20wnd#8203
and i only made that workflow to let people see how broken that is
that is even included in the first place
but idk why
also told them to delete jelbreklib.dylib as well because copyright
because copyright, copyright bro i told them
plus they deleted libsnappy.c
nothing
well i got a few files deleted from manticore suace tree
not funny at all
not funny then
linus untether uses a rather static approach
gir doing its job
mantiscam
hi rick
fruhh
sudo -u nobody
!t untether
and compile tons of stuff on it
don't want people say that i broke their fone
won't tell
unless you have some special setup
because there's no way that the cooling can be normally maintained at top speed
which i don't recommend
you are pretty much overclocking if you turn of thermal throttling
a very chill admin
cam doesn't care
save blob without jb or pc
there's a thing called tswaps
unless it's onboard blobs
then you can't save
libiosexec moment
some dumb term coined by u0 users
although there is also a pseudo terminal on the ipad side
nah that's a  shell on ipad spawned onto a linux remote terminal
some u0 users do because it's ~~'procursus drm'~~
don't expose me bro
and that for sure got its behaviour tweaked by libiosexec1
ik i say stuff that people can't understand a lot
wdym literal
libiosexec1 is a tweak because it modifies the execv, execp, posix_spawn behaviour
but no one make tweaks in format of dyld shared caches yet
technically dyld shared caches can be tweaks too with latest libhooker
but not all libraries are tweaks
tweaks are libraries
!t untether
they don't use a tweak injector (or rather ,the injector is dyld) but you can still say these are tweaks
imagine getting filtered
because it does tweak some functions
you could call libiosexec and libeatmydata a tweak i wont say no to that
id rather not call bash a  tweak
it doesn't inject stuff into processes
that's an app
hello
tswaps is very hacky
you can literally inspect element on discord "desktop"
- chromebook
everything is a site specific browser
basically fake signing server with nonce grabber iirc
or am i dumb
tswaps
save blob for audioaccessory
after that
with it
and you get about 1 gb of space you can actually do
there is probably just enough space
should still work
rsync -ap oldroot newroot
100 weeks are weeks
in the coming weeks just like the checkra1n loader
because you said there were no changes
nevermind
don't say pycord
then what library are you going to use
by editing the db to add devices
that's what i mean
yeah and if the db somehow has 11th device it's not going to crash will it
without changing the code
and somehow add more devices
he could just mess with the db
arm64 is not supported in the current state
~~although i only have 1 device added~~
can i get my limit raised to 15
you still need to get up to amfid takedown before you can execute additional code
and that's f a t
u need to bundle all the bootstraps
plus at that point you would be shipping 4 slices in a macho file
that's dumb
and checkra1n is a usb stack bootrom jailbreak
jailbreakme is a safari jailbreak
the thing is
how are you going to combine something like checkra1n and jailbreakme
that just won't work
although it means more specific stuff in this context
an irl friend
get a new best friend
taurine
geo is ok-ish
imagine using u0 sth
if you ask an admin nicely and don't ping they might
be a booster
mantiscam
that's the short answer
manticore is a scam
with other package managers
just like the checkra1n loader
actually coming weeks
probably not
when non-interactive iso
we have untether exploit on ios 11
wait wrong server
i'm referring to like 14.4b1
no, not that
jailbreaks
from 0 day to 200+ days
we in fact are
well more stable than normal checkra1n that is
it is still stable
maybe not
can confirm
nevermind wrong channel
'giveaway sponsors'
i thini they are cool
restart terminal
which is a simpler shell
there is chsh on ios
that's a federal crime
ok but that isn't piracy either
the info
where does the readme file comes from
not talking to you
or suddenly large amounts of text printed on the console
did any oops happen
nah that's fine
how come you didn't straight up get a kernel panic
that could happen as well
ive got a few broken bins that tries to access 0x0
it means it is trying to access invalid or disallowed to access memory pages
ok do a ldrestart first
go to software updates
or webhooks
elu is literally more outdated than debian stable while being unstable
nah more like from 2019
sileo 1.x works
iphone 4
i used cydia
it was called prometheus then renamed to fr iirc
origin of fr is prometheus
but larger is better
or rather ,non-toxicity
toxicity
no i mean like
!t delayota
wait yes that exists
you don't
for a member+
or admin that got token logged whatever
remember it is a token logger
later
he installed com.paranmat.noncemanager_1.0_iphoneos-arm.deb
imagine token logging
discord though you used a vpn
paranmat
then admin isn't admin
with librsvg
it isn't that bad
60 iq
we still have am radio in here
ok but it is  not digitally generated
not *all* per se
lol no
if you really wanted to
u can print them
tell richard that
especially if it's a small userbase
they do cost something
too long = how long?
tell m$ that
but then it still costs stuff to mak them
basically tiny bit of electricity and a tiny bit of storage writes
just miniscule
digital goods does cost physical stuff, even just to replicate
me trying to be a greenname
!t eta
gm rick
is a n word
on that
does that site even load
wen eta iso 69 jelbrek
0 xp moment
i know a whitename with 0 xp that is very chill too
a lot of those appears orange
there's member plus that are chill but
there's many member plus that are chill
people are nice to me when im whitename
i try to follow that
we need member two
diff -urn mempro mem-edition
are mempros any good
but then there's also mem+ that act like member edition
although not a very accurate description
nah ik what this person is referring to
me chilling on ipad6,3 on ios 14.3
there's also testing and a whole stack of other stuff
but that's the bare time
realistically
arm64 probably another few hours as well
arm64
yeah an hour
coming up
probably
on the 21st it's going to be another waiting game
!t untether
imagine using fr in live medium
!t chart
just dump the checkra1n executable from odysseyn1x iso
this person wants reverse tethering
because why not
ok, or mess with the write protection screw
just use developer mode on chromebook ez
developer mode
well ipad 2 on ios 4.3 is also fucked
chromebook is fine
14.5.1 so
actually
ipad6,3
inb4 where can i find the bypass named "no bypass"
or working build instructions
where can i find a build of futurerestore for aarch64 windows
based
because i don't have macos
do you have any of the betas then
we already know what's going on with the bug
probably more betas as well but idk
at least beta 1
yes linus said that
has untether
!t untether
`01:14 am`
who are your bitches
imuseum knows
for sure
no one knows
r-word = restart
where
where
dyld closures literally doesn't exist on 10
we know for sure untether won't work on 11 to 13
well yes
and token logger
i still have dms with paranmat
this is a reference to aaron and 23 aaron
with $99 account
cydia impactor is usable
but better
more like cydia impactor
not anymore right now
but, it was officially hosted and only hosted on a piracy site
that tool in itself has always been fine
revoked moment
wheres jtv
maybe he will release as is
i mean
!t untether
!t untether
all the good tags gets deleted
like what happened in sileo discord a while ago
when will we all become cameren
deleted channel
and you didn't mention region
for iphone os 1.0.1
i think that tool is involved
used to jailbreak with iphuc or something
i think
if you keep userspace rebooting
technically theres a kernbypass ios 14 but it only works with libkrw
!t untether
aight
or no such file or directory
error -2 is enoent
because it's almost like you typed incorrectly
try that
still
home dir filled up with tons of stuff again
welp, time to do a rountine rm -rf on my pc
apt is faster than sileo
then resign that bin
just install openssh-server and ldid
not newterm
that library is a taurine payload
how would that help
that's the reason
not having platform-application entitlement
firing wall general
mr. token starts with mfa.
does it start with this
odmymdcxmju0mdu5mjuzodmxcg
how do i mount anywhere on taurine
!t untether
i use unencrypted keys am i bad
looks like sandbox issue but idk specifics
idk why
and this is not supposed to happen
working directory moment
forgot sudo
there's also
sileo discord
apparently pac and ppl bypass isn't even required
which is very possible
getting caught up in a raid
unless it is raid
ipad getting hot and laggy
inverted colours
that's in accessibility
on the phone moves
did  the progress bar
normal
iosuckball
all the pixels are #000000
so how do i fix the typing indicator
nflower
cameren is typing...
how do i fix the typing indicator
ask real cameren
when will ios 14 become legacy
but i have no 30 pin devices
i still have a completely intact 30 pin
sounds like battery is fucked
like wtf
lowest i have been is
*** prolonged periods below 10%
and yes they made it less secure in 14.0
rip bozo
which won't have an untether for the time being
better than those stuck on 13
even with that
because you can't
i'm not a native speaker either.
better save some onboard blobs
!t blobs
upgrade like that
you don't
not need it
you want it
thanks
nothing happened
secure enclave is the whole thing in general
secure enclave processor
also something like that will always be tethered unless we have untethered bootrom exploit
and doesn't really work
someone tried that
os for sep
fdr is also fine
just not savage
also sepos is compatible
if it is savage then it might be possible to do something with pwndfu
but slow
not anything lower
after some research it's more like ios 14.0-some ios14.6 betas
here you go
ik no one asked for this but
especially when microsoft intentionally made it harder to do it in windows
200 mb usb will do
and i don't want to see people making windows non-bootable on accident
messing with uefi isn't the easiest thing
of course you need vmlinuz and ramdisk.cpio.xz, as well as the iso itself
can't you just mess with uefi and add an linux entry
there is
in that case uikit might work
ppid could be debugserver
exit appears to be called within libsystem_c.dylib
at least that's what lldb says
that moment when pojavlauncher calls exit when launched
that's iphone 11 iirc
iphone12,1 is not iphone 12
the real cameren that's relevant is offline
:fruhhhd:
that moment when like 20 people in sileo discord called themselves cameren
iphone os 1.0.1 for iphone1,1
then fix your name
why am i called nick chan
if you connect an already dfued device via usb c and use checkra1n cli it works
dfu doesn't but checkra1n itself does
probably the -e bug
!t checkra1n
don't
11 can use another bug for untether
dyld closures is unavailable for 3rd party apps in ios 12 and 11
i *don't* think so
and yes that's the exact opposite of a certain commit message
this is checkra1n_memo, not procursus
when the procur is sis
~~hayden seay is super talented bro how did he made so much stuff~~
that moment when parcility assumes maintainer === author
do you think a random apple store employee have that
thatsthejoke.png
that's an apple employee
technically
hayden seay
it won't unless companies get mad for not having ipsw option
can probably fr to 14.5.1 later
i have 14.3 ipad6,3
don't ask
and given that coolstar actually has their own untether exploit implementation
since odyssey 13.7 update is like super fast
probably
so this is even more "hardware" then a bootrom exploit
not just immutable software
actual design error
it's actual hardware exploit
that's not a bootrom exploit
not real
who knows, maybe something else will get discovered later
let's wait to see what this tinkering will lead us up to
maybe not even able to play video so
bruh autocarrot
what cve
dyld closures are introduced in ios 11
(but that may not be related)
dyld closures are unavailable for 3rd party apps in ios 12 and 11 so
at least
actually
not that version
wen dev role for linhe#0046
i know a bit about weather but not much
i didn't
that's like not related
real!
it's just that they got tugged into the drama
shulkk never actually logged anyone's token iirc
in addition
hello is ez
or hello
do bash
yes but that's not related to your server at all
nekofetch is removed
for no apparent reason in your server
because he is banned
system home is %windows%\system32\systemprofile
penis balls
penis cock
penis
no, i really don't think it is paranmat
doesn't seem to be a bad idea either
aka bypass a bunch of stuff
fr tho: member one should be made level 4 in filter
member two wen
there's also member+ in sileo discord
cuz you can't repeat characters
pretty sure gir is a member+
or rather ,gir denied its own permissions
and gir lagged to hell
orange whitenames exists because they just don't talk
!t eta
because none of your other roles allows it
when it will actually deny access
pretty sure discord doesn't allow denying your own permissions
they don't speak
a lot because
yeah idk why tags cmds gets deleted
there's quite some whitename developers
how about that
developers
member+
how about red whitenames
what are the problem with whitenames rn
hdik: attach failed: error 0xe00002c9 = -536870199
(it is 1028 because paritions)
just not 1024th
1023th disk work
actually
it fails at 1023 i think
and i can't seem to attach more
attaching 1000+ disks to it
uwubuntu
ok, why does gir delete the tags
actually possible to see filtered stuff
also the filter is slow rn
so pls don't
never speak again
then that will start to break as well
if it deletes enough messages
just by doing that
so someone could technically hang gir
still ded
too many disks
on a 2 gb ram device
= not based on stuff available right now
got my first custom panic
got darwin 21.1.0 panic
ik a few
to sileo
unknown piracy repo
it's going to reboot after 90 seconds anyways
i have ssh key that can login to like 17 servers
u are going to delete ur keys
ssh-keygen -r 192.168.0.103
straight up dfu loop
just by jailbreaking with u0
i have bootlooped school ipads as well
by interrupting a restore
~~just recovery loop it and trade it in~~
:flower:
although i might do it myself then
how about later
:nangryfaceid:
ship the blobs with the device
:nprochan:
:nflower:
of coprocessors
doesn't restore firmware
nfrld
privacy.html
download.html
seay's server
stole it
:woeisnfrhd:
:woeisfrhd:
:nfrhd:
device
pongoos register itself as the usb slave
why would i restore a device just to prove a point
it isn't useless
frcoal
you are doing right
not usable right now but continue saving them
(i just assumed you have no blobs  because random people ask like this almost never saved blobs)
which is only done in futurerestore testing
in recovery mode
unless you use them immediately after it is saved
need jailbreak to use blobs
what device
devices
ok but it is compatible on some
in the first place
well did you save them
kanye west
gn `12:33 am`
because there's no way
buy another device
because dpkg broke
and it is known that zebra isn't the best in managing packages
although that's fixed in like 20 minutes
moment
killed: 9
that alone could already break stuff
like updating sources index
using it to do anything can break stuff
because you used zebra
in compression
and yes that's a 10x difference
there's results
`apt search pongoterm`
slow bot
iinsertthinghere
charge it
that's literally what it is supposed to do
real!
unreal!
how does the dm even got leaked
what leak
ibrickstage1
tzst files
nathan 1 nathan 2
and get people banned
don't mind me it is ez to fake a fake dm ads
cuz it broke some stuff
we gotta test this on *everything* supported
libiosexec
easiee than you think
it's easier for an update on procursus to accidentally break everyone's jailbreak beyond repair
soemtimes i just doesn't like procursus having a single point of failure
for a9x
appearently there's no pwndfu tool
for a9
...for now
i looked for it for 4 hours
pretty sure that's possible with pwndfu
all procursus chan images are raster images
that i'd like to add
potrace is another thing
but we still do gnome stuff
aka no kde apps
well gtk will do for now
server
you need
and i'm not very sure how citra will work
figure out gtk + qt and then more stuff can be added
need gtk for that
well one of them
but yes i will use them
i don't *need* that per se
one of them
~~and make some people think a certain tweak is a virus~~
debianize so we can just copy paste debian depends
saw that too
not debianized
and timezone
fix your clock
there's a 0.1% chance that discordtokengrab gets accepted
how about linux or freebsd
can i build on ios
and not applicable
shell-cmds is fine too because that's entirely different
make on procursus manages to break
and idk how the latest
libiosexec is fine
libirecovery3 moment
chromium
does web browser work
there's a reason uxterm exists
aterm wen
konsole
the characters are all squares
xterm is broken with locales
already got ldid manpages in chinese
nice locale
it's in mesa-demos
well that doesn't make it not a bug
when there is
it says there is no x server
with optfine.jar
tried a while ago
that doesn't work
locales of jwm itself works fine
as you can see locales are broken in xterm
ipad getting hot
that moment when discord stores token in a plist
turns out make 4.3-6 on procursus is broken
reinstalled all depended dylibs as well
once got 75 days uptime on odysseyra1n
already managed to run kernel with disk support on 24 mb ram
brb imma trigger my newterm ci
systemdos
newterm not liking wide characters moment
power button
i have a discharged device cannot be dfued after charging for 14 days
because that's the account that is **main**ly used
technically if an alt get used enough times then by definition that's not alt
no one is entitled to anything
that isn't quite valid in my opinion
there must be other reasons
bro how does not reporting something get people banned
hiding until level 50 something is very hard
extremely stealthly
well that very stealth
plus the emulator has crap speed on x86
yes but not really
found sshd rce exploit all you need is the targets' priavte keys (and passpharse)
no one knows how much
almost certainly no jbd
i mean it could also work in termux
and a good usb controller
well you should technically be able to
and that's called bootm8
that's dead tho
yes there was too
imagine using a safari skin
ra1nbox it is that exists
because a cpu register is accidentally exposed to any process
completely useless exploit that allows two process to communicate without using any normal methods
the m1 exploit is actual hardware exploit
technically
it exploits unmodifiable software
and older jailbreaks
(except checkra1n)
more like
workaround it
we need to be able to control what to corrupt and corrupting in what way
a xnu version of bsod
a total crash
advanced developer removed as well
pov: he doesn't
wen givehaydendevrole after givedoregondevrole
you can just bootloop
now if it could corrupt arbitrary memory in a specific way that's something else
that just means that it could corrupt some kernel memory in some way
mean a jailbreak
causing a crash doesn't necessarily
something
a manual page for ldid
aight
!t whyjbtv
ms^-2
find ill get xterm
12 is ok
last updated in 2013
org.coolstar.fakekernelpanic
again, no one really knows how much will be released
!t untether
stkc doesn't know
i can't get the logic in this
in the coming "few weeks" just like other package managers in the checkra1n app
it's always s0n
actually
pretty sure 3.75 gb is good enough
how big
no ban
it's more like use b because a is broken but a isn't fixed
it doesn't really *fix* per se but it will let you get through
yes, already tried with 32 bit linux before
yes that's one way to workaround that
just bypass it by connecting in recovery mode
jwm looks nice
that's a7 nonce collision
because i don't have the something
probably
screw it and use libkernrw to swap our profile with mdnsresponder's profile in memory
some of them could be removed with a modified backup
apply a sandbox profile
how are we supposed to use a
as long as the program can do io on arbitrary files
but not really sure on that one
sometimes i think that disk device access should be in general
give entitlements
u need no-container
you can save blobs without jailbreak
unless it has other ways of setting nonce
you need jailbreak to use blobs
unreal
no a9x
that's the problem
put that into pwndfu
how do i
where can i find a checkm8 nonce setter for a9x
pretty sure zsign + ideviceinstaller works on windows
sauce
devhelper sauce code
no i mean
ew it's loud here
doesn't really care about being hoisted
or not
hm, time to be apple executive i guess
don't use bootra1n
odysseyra1n
checkra1n
restore system
need table discussion bro
(don't do it like that)
ok it isn't that bad mind you
real?
cydia don't break jailbreaks
reset all contents and settings
ldid.exe
it's u0 after all so
a possibility
there is
install & start usbmuxd
since that's 100% in clear now
when can we get altserver-linux tags
x32 abi is a real thing
when windows doesn't have a x32 abi
that moment when sideloadly says x32 download itunes
sideloadly
u gotta use 1.3.6-crashfix
eta in 10 years
not the most  simplistic thing
uefi efi stub moment
not necessarily
actually
what table
hello
and tsssaver
i use autotss
eta in 10 years ok?
debug symbols moment
you can download them when it is signed technically
sometimes there's not-so-uncommon situation that there are no signed versions
altstore doesn't need jb
no one cares about 15.0.2
pretty sure that's logged
but i can't figure what getting filtered here
gotta love it when we don't have ldid_linux_m68k
when they aren't whitenames or member plus
they do when they aren't whitenames anymore
on this
restore rootfs would free 6-7 gb on my device
that said i don't think it's very good
if you ask nicely
yeah it's ez to get devs respond there
hack different moment
well pointless
ldid -u is useless
(obviously im biased but)
because it is
!t odysseyra1n
!t shortcut
ibrick
then you still have a bootstrap
uicache -a runs for
how long does
for procursus
are you on latest uicache
(time)
apt.elucubratus.com
knew that
elu don't bootloop last time i checked
and yes that links goes to youtube
parcility has piracy until like a day ago
i mean
many stuff on procursus don't compile for 1300
(almost) every ubuntu user ever
but yes not officially
sileo is initially designed for ios 11 so it makes sense that builds that runs on ios 10 are available somewhere
there's probably like 1 - 10 on ios
many people uses repos with multiple components
ok who works on it now
but ok
... except that i'm actually not aware
but that's hell so pls don't use that
eta now
wen eta components: one two
and yes this will be released, a few messages down of that message
250 messages up
wen eta rootless procursus
systemversion.plist
weather very bad outside here
pacman is on ios
when they are first used
which means that most battery has a capacity slightly higher than the designed capacity
and most battery should have a capacity reaching at least a certain threshold
not every battery made has the same capacity
it's normal?
~~it's procursus-chan~~
on a9x
and don't ask me how i have so little battery degradation
don't use the one on bigboss
233 cycles
a9x moment
on a charger
source: my ipad battery went down 3% when clang was eating up all the cpu resources
but any higher it probably wouldn't go down provided the the device supports it
(depends on cable length and stuff)
as well as a 10w in some cases
in the highest load
battery could go down on a 5w charger
not 127.0.0.1 only
you need to listen
need a tool that allows me to mount bindfs on taurine
there's a few ways to do that, and is not necessarily rootless
very simple just don't remount the system volume
wifi is convenient i guess
well we will wait to see if this can be used to chain that exploit
when is appleave2 bug patched?
then that could be chained
if that bug existed on 14
appleave2
so more than mobile
that needs root i think
not necessarily
at least root probably
well from what it says
like fr
3.46 kb
wait imma send ldid.1
the flags
very sus but no way to prove that's piracy
minceraft
prison break
when i jailbroke my iphone discord didn't exist
troll!
hello
getting checkra1n app to appear ez way: run checkra1n cli with device connected
!t odysseyra1n
build number
technically
ios 11
home depot
well at your skill level you are messed up
basically you are messed up so restore rootfs
!t taurine
and unc0ver decided to break
don't use unc0ver
remove jb
samarium
unc0ver moment
for this purpose
relevant enough
just like there are two nathans that are relevant
so what i said is ambiguous
github
and appearently adam follows me
me looking at who follows me be like:
people buy 2006 laptops
idk how to describe that
ios 14 has but doesn't have sealed rootfs
such as the lighting digital av adapter
checkm8 devices are still being sold
is it still broke after reinstalling filza
it says what it is
and debs can run arbitrary maintainer scripts
and debs store files
10 probably not because dyld2
11 can use another bug
dyld closures for 3rd party apps are introduced in ios 13
so it is definitely possible
the data are arranged on disk
untethered is triggered by a specific way
like etason
if the untether is packaged as a deb then yes
although it really should have been for odysseyra1n
that isn't implemented in libhooker
every untether has a safe boot feature
let's not ignore that
and bindfs is confirmed
bindfs is like not rootless but actually rootless
or pull some bindfs tricky which is ugly af, require storage space and won't work for app based
which they don't
unless they just make it tethered
21 st
everything is broken
or put it simply
and get that filtered
make piracy repo named 0ver or smth
you can say that
not substrate safe mode
but the proper way of doing that is deleting substrate
it will
but yes
**remove
using narrow definition of tweak
because that isn't a tweak
that said stuff like newterm is not deleted
and therefore all tweaks
you delete substrate
~~write some code for us we having hard time keeping everything updated~~
uh oh!
just use linux
they most definitely do
can we have nautilis
so the os ramdisk will need to find it
and those things only work up until bootloader level
gm although you should say ge to me
and this is where stuff could go wrong
after ventoy boots something the os still need to know where its files are
10.3 has apfs version 1
and boot from usb
if you put the iso to the root of the c: drive it could work
actually
also plz have them build on linux
use the shortcut
!t odysseyra1n
so uh use checkn1x
so that's irrelevant
plus if it boots to initramfs it's already pass that
dd mode
doesn't
odysseyn1x
two more what
that will avoid that problem
that runs entirely off a ramdisk
use checkn1x
how does it refuse
that is genius right?
ipad pro 9.7 wifi on 14.3
also i have a very strange problem with checkra1n where;
bootstrap
why would you install checkra1n
and i think it's bound to happen before 21st century wraps up
i do realize that
it won't take that long
you don't flash a processor
sep = secure enclave processor
because you don't flash an actual chip
you don't flash sep or have incompatible sep between versions
and i heard that the pongoos usb driver isn't very good
single event effect
this pro chan is nick chan
how are apple supposed to verify the passcode
i have no idea how that works
even work
how does unlock with passcode
i believe that worked on a9 at least
that depends on how you define working
what wt
no you don't
you don't
although i do count something like ftsb's release as a functional jailbreak
well that depends if the demo is released as is
but limited devices & no jbd
to be fair it is possible that the jailbreak is functional
don't use windows
idk windows
somehow this is still open
sshfs-win exists
idk, i seldom use windows
install openssh-sftp-server
what pc os
if i change term= to linux it works
for bash
bash has a help command
to the outside
my ipad ssh is exposed
change both root and mobile
wrong password
it's good
just changed my ipad resolution
downgrade to 10.3.3
checkra1n.sys
basically unless you write a custom usb driver it is not going to work
and even if you somehow got usb passthrough (which is possible) windows *really* does not like partial usb transfers
sidea
plus it's dyld closures
there additional checks
untether is patched in 14.6
pwndfu actually
i think rootfs snapshot broke?
well free of charge
all jb apps are free
where is stkc's bitch
wen eta bohr model
just create it yourself
cuz that looks like something that could be done with libkernrw
on tauirne
well i want working mount_bindfs
asn.1 decode lzss decompress and `strings` and `grep`
ios 15.1 beta
checkra2n
sentinel is ok
tim cook
there's also this
masterofmike - !t yt is typing
ok heres a waifu
procursus dropbear is also fine
delete preboot
u0 still uses sha-1 for repos
ssh password
or substituted that is what they call it
u0 jbd is bad
cuz gpl violation
because u0 is piracy
u0 has built-in piracy
ok, but
cuz advertisment ok?
u0 bad because it's bad
and reinstall the mail plug in
update altserver
we need amdmoment tag
amd moment
it's setbirthday i think
wait whats that command i forgot
ultimate parcility moment
that looks like a piracy repo
wtf why would gir have that
they changed the author
well gplv3 or later
??????
also make sure you are on latest commit
clang -os -wall -wextra -duse_libusb=1 -lpthread -lusb-1.0 pongoterm.c -o pongoterm
(which includes android)
then pongoterm will compile on linux
-duse_libusb=1
pongoterm
we stan procursus-chan
well the surface
and keep it cold
try more times
apple did too much trolling
that's dumb
change the load commands
use install_name_tool to
ik what he means
nah i want -42069 warnpoints
who knows
wen eta iso 42 checkra2n jelbrek
has acpi
does that laptop
reboot: system halted
fruhh
what messages
on odysseyra1n
ok i got a random panic
python
gotta love it when stuff says i'm on macos 14.3
show that i have piracy
get a $30 used laptop that woll work
this person probably doesn't have pc
because apple changed the kernel version string
a7 checkm8 also sucks hell as well
because exploit sucks hell
and then you can try debug using sileo and newterm
which i won't bother explain here
unless you know a lot
probably
restore rootfs
there's restore rootfs option in chimera
ipad mini 3 moment
such as?
did you try 99 times?
with a fridge if required
rule 14 ffs
and the device better be cool
chimera needs a lot of tries
obviously
they can't expect every enterprise to handle this
now that's stupid
no because now apps expires eveey 72 hours
it isn't
it isn't terrible in itself
probably not
epic emote sync fail
on ios
not necessarily
cuz gnu mount would just try to mount it again with ro if rw didn't work
command
aight
cuz im not actually sure of what is needed
u didn't update dpkg in a long time did you
did it actually print that
it will print it
attach2 doesn't mount either
u mount it manually
it doesn't
same thing but better
use hdik
after restore rootfs
reset all contents and settings
that doesn't do it
there's a xnu_ramdisk command in pongoos
cuz tried with pongoos upload_data.py just refuses to work
is it even possible to boot ssh ramdisk on linux
i just misunderstood something
i know
wen procursus_rd.dmg
i misunderstood something nvm
mounting varfs with ramdisk
not recovery loop
update: messing with rootfs will dfu loop on ios 15
now i won't say that is actual untether bugs
spv does have some bfu auto execution bugs
athenus is afu
yeah that's afu
voip isn't bfu
now of course something can be real but sucks
i do consider that be real using his definition of untether although i don't agree with that definition
now i actually don't agree with some point in there but it's a good read
jailbreak 2017 iphone using 1990 pc
cat it for long enough and it will appear
also the announcement doesn't mention ipads
don't think so
cuz librem 5 and pinephone
but i said 'not android'
u already did technically
!t usbc
don't use usbc
and yes he doesn't actually use them anymore
and yes he doesn't actually use them anymore
and s4
in particular a note 2 and note 3
some samsungs
i should ask my dad for some devices
pretty sure you could dump the encrypted data
it does reset bios data
and of course the key
including the time
on the motherboard
that will reset everything
motherboard
on the
the battery
remove the cmos battery
go ahead
operation not supported by device
you don't need to run this on another ios device
ok but
thing is it doesn't work
saurik made electron app befire electron exists
sftp with sshfs is the best
that has like no features
also hi
that could happen
that doesn't do a thing: see unc0ver
taurine is open source
partially
windows mobile isn't good
because it does
with downgrade
u can use -u
but not any newer version
i think
that's like true on ios
i hope not a strapproject
subproject?
hdik -nomount disk.dmg
overwrite some instructions
assembly hooking
instead of an apple offical bin
why would you use this
use clang directly
use it
you just
real mac
using an executable that uses arm converter
technically you can sideload ipa free dev cert on linux
linux users
so that's a thing
as well
there's region you can't use app store
???? why
to i use arch btw's makefile as well
i did a big patch
don't mind me
if the makefile is good then it's fine
so if you bootloop an a15 it's an hard brick
because mount restrictions
chimera is so bad
aa is not in ipsw ramdisk
hi trop
all onto the ground
well spilled mercury
and it is super annoying to clean up
libeatmydata soon
dvd image?
there is procursus macos
remember
are we cracking dvds
hicolor-icon-theme
so does it work
kelvin
just suspend the discord client and inspect its memory ez
channel name and channel topic are technically public
theme
so where
on some regional models
of the camera
where can i find a tweak to disable the shutter sound
these are platform-application bypasses
**done.**
suid fileproviderctl with mobile:mobile because sandbox doesn't like root
ok so
fake untethered
on ios 14.3
i know how to execute a binary
but does not have exploit that defeat the codesign checks
but imo resigning is the actual pain
phone jailbreaks itself without user interaction but resigning is required (which is why these aren't actual untethers)
also tethered of course
and fake untethered (not in the sense that the jailbreak is fake)
there's also semi-untethered
rootless does give kernel access
they do
that's the only more consistent definition whether a jailbreak is normal
rootless vs not rootless
there is
there are no regular or irregular
200 mb is fine
would it be possible to bring back the old five dots signal indicator
out of  a perfect circular orbit immediately
relativity and tidal effects will drag the objects
everyone knows that real orbits are elliptical
-e -e -e -e -e
i use arch btw makefile
how much of pp are there
contents-iphoneos-arm
i need to decrypt haywire kernel and ramdisk
u want me to port entire kde
thatd takes days to compile and that assume nothing goes wrong
kate is also an ide probably
notepad++ vs nano
u can extract xip on linux
(still need some patches obviously)
(almost)
aka their linux version
write their own implementation
they are just going to do thing thing they did with cicuta_virosa
is ios 12.5.5 darwin 18.7.1
did some linux magic
also the vm runs fine with 23 mb of ram
(obviously that's a custom kernel)
32 mb ram i486dx
also that's a9x ipad
which is very difficult
more like there are no ways to abuse it
mainly related to postmarketos stuff
the last time i see any real work related to sandcastle is **4 weeks ago**
got accepted
that thing isn't on any repos
not that
archbtw interpreter
the first thing i did is send a fake message with it
a directory named 'mkdir'
'mkdir'
you also creates stuff named
well technically yes
your mkdir is outright broken
xfce4-session
2010 style
that website is like
troll
iuab brainfuck
maybe but  i need to do iuab first
psa: if you are here just to shit on manticore without providing actual help, please leave. people are allowed to have their own preference of jailbreak without being told they are wrong
and joined around the same time
it's all alts with same pfp lol
cuz raid
nvram boot-args='no32exec=0 -v'
manticore
semi untethered failbreak
without pc
tethered won't turn on
bootrom untethered are the best
absolutely nothing actually
~~80x24~~
lmfao
user memory that is
sino-dows
other than causing a panic
manticore doesn't work
need arm64 xcodebuild
probably if i tried hard enough
gotta love that author = maintainer assumption
wow hayden seay made so much stuff
i think
file-cmds
package libc libm, libpthread, dyld
so it didn't affect anythings
and diskarbitration doesn't exist on ios
on arm64
because i tried to use arm64e framework
it didn't
copyig frameworks
you need to download the signature
i know sometimes apple messes themselves up and there are no signed firmware
autotss good
i, use, arch, btw, linux, by, the, way
but the operators
it's brainfuck interpreter
not that
i use arch btw on procursus wen
do friend-invite
because fakeroot
that moment when sip disabled is technically a procursus dependency
balls
why not custom repo smh
plz dont comprise my server
already torrented a bunch of isos without problems
cors anywhere ffs
connection
metered
free unless
for a vpn
system
dedicated
you don't
u mean  $8?
at that point
samsung
use a non-default port
use vpn
how to answer
as well
by that logic they block github they should block google and youtube
they are all sketchy chinese sites
there's github mirrors as well
use mirror
hook lhhookfunctions with lhhookfunctions
where is the headers and stuff
ok so
where can i find libhooker development resources
they *are* computing devices
and a lot of people don't care about the "phone" part
smartphones are personal computers
you can't deny that
get fucked
oauth2
discord rpc
with a custom driver and usb controller
a7 can have good success rate too if you send the right packets
the bootrom is completely deterministic
and how come there isn't one for say 10 and 11
that works on ios 5
ios 6
put procursus on that
although that can be said for almost every checkm8-compatible device
technically you "just" need the right setup
that is worse
(better than a5)
also a7 checkm8 is big bad
well maybe 32 gb if that exists and if it is solely used for testing
trust me you need 64 gb
16 gb
protip: don't mess with demotion
i only know that person as the person that made fugu
there's ridiculous amount of stuff in xfce gtk and qt
i hope so
all pr?
well 13.0b1 if it's about third party app closures
unless
cuz dyld3 and closures
down to 11.0b1
shouldn't the untethered bug work
idk why they didn't add a thing
tested on checkra1n
libhooker doesn't have that
pls don't ignore that every untether has safe boot
codesigning
useless except making my phone crash
add back !t real bro
that is actually the most serious one
but that sounds incredibly unlikely
unless... chained with something else
don't look useful
looked at them
give me apple secure boot ca - g2 private key
untethered bootrom + baseband + sep + probably-some-other-microcontroller exploits drops
just wait until
ldid -scontainer.xml cameren
it is
think that's already done somewhere
if you say'any'
the most likely result is it ends up something like liberios
more like u0 6.2.0-1 and chimera 1.6.3-1
well coolstar did mention freezer
that's actually from
to do with temperature
it does has something
use checkra1n
technically if you don't bypass it it is not against the rules
need computing power bro
that technically not icloud bypass it itself
im particularly interested in amfid bypass and code injection
where
need an ios 14 jb writeup tbh
just do nothing
but it opens
won't work obviously
it just
on odysseyra1n
substitute settings
i installed
bsod kinda is
bsod it is
assuming watchdogd is still working properly
at 90s
it's gonna panic
something-keyring
named like that
there are packages
reinstall these packages
but well since internet is working
the signature file download that could be affected by internet
check your internet
also binutils has 3 controls
was thinking about that
u can airdrop ios to macos
wait nevermind
sshfs works very well
sshfs
that's when i wanted to do that and failed completely
less than binutils
wdym pack
also it builds on freebsd
50% of x11
which is  required for like
remember glib2.0 still broke
procursus was made on linux
and pls make sure these works on linux
gtk and qt man
*used to
i bootloop biweekly
to restore
just use blobs
macos
don't we have xfce terminal
because you deleted important files
it does
no reason for it to not turn on
stock
real tmp
or is that something else
11 years
isn't stuff broken for like
including the libdvdnav4 one
well i correct some of them
i did
and stuff won't compile on linux
especially since i broke the hackintosh
meanwhile on my side vlc made no progress :(
disable password log in
cuz i wanted that like forever
include xfce?
there's overlapped files in hppa64-*
binutils
still figuring out
just impossible to request under normal circumstances
basically abuses that tss does not immediately unsign after 90 days
coolbooter moment
resign
get ios 9.1
ios 9.1
unless
april 26 ffs
after april 26
a very short window
of doing that
there is a super complicated way
because
april 27
actually
5 months
actually
13.5.4 doesn't exist
that moment when i only have one device to use
dont hack my vps
u have ios 5.1.1
i have remote ssh for my ipad
no it's not
does xnu-qemu-arm64 has remount
ipod touch 7
it is
wait actually
print the disk devices allocated
even then the update ramdisk is still hfs
except ipsw dmgs
a lot of dmgs are hfs
you need to mount it
just never do the acpi power down
halt on linux still brings down the system
and why it saves battery
it's named halt for a reason
!t eta
yes even on checkra1n
trying to make elucubratus to work
they are probably
probably jailbreak
no use checkra1n with odysseyra1n
in binutils
still need to figure out all the overlapping files
save battery
halt is in this package
to save battery
best executable
`halt`
and may not have not any kind of bundlename.bundletype
a package can have files all over the filesystem
there are no bundle
package name is not the name: field
u mean
package name
`sudo apt purge`
comex attach and detach
well thats actually nyamisty attach2
you got jb device
`attach2 file.dmg`
~~inb4 apple ships developer stuff in stock ios 16 and get rid of dynamic trustcache~~
and some of those just flat out doesn't work
which has a rather low success rate
or the androids
checkra1n is compiled for i486
mind you
i386 don't
that probably can run checkra1n :)
and 256 mb ddr2 ram
i remember that
or something
wait who is that person that has a pentium m
you are not the worst
also skip a11 bpr check
that should work
!t nosep
!t checkra1n
!t odysseyra1n
anyways
because it doesn't exist
your blob doesn't exist and cannot be created
you don't
1042 errors
something about pinned messages
ok so i managed to bug discord client
....what?
also im outside
aight 7:46 am
**done.**
android
totally not arch btw
i use discord btw
btw i use discord
blobs
nick chan for mem edition eta wen?
because there's actual eta
which couldn't really be eta kids
plz imagine selfbot using shortcuts
button press safemode
on checkra1n
that would also be good to have
to be fair
pangu 9.1
there's one (1) kpp bypass untether
well libhooker needs to implement button press safemode
when macos 15.0
aight
wait let me send some emotes
linus tweeted
wen checkra1n i386 support
what's with this illegal instruction
illgeal instruction moment
there's a lot of forks
yep realized that
not again
for almost everything
*usually* if you go on pc and grab the analog vga stream it will work
yes you need actual hardware for that
pretty sure lighting digital av cable works for that
bad posts
not bypass
block icloud bypass
bypass shouldn't be blocked
now that's stupid
let's see how people will react over my completely meaningless tweet
iphone os 1
that's like
still rocking with a9x ipad
!t checkra1n
fake site moment
it doesn't
on 14.4
u0 doesn't work
*proof of persistent bfu crash
could also be athenus crap
that only shows that there's a bug tho
look at the clock
technically he did show persistent crash
aren't dyld closures introduced in ios 11
if using checkra1n on a11 on ios 14
then don't jailbreak
you don't
so what's wrong with that
what makefile
blobs are specific to one device
this is a real question
plz help how can i stay sane when dealing with stupidity
just delete & umount
anyways "change name pls" doesn't actually make stuff easier given the number of them
regardless of name
akso it's ez to ping people with user id
verbose log
verbose boot
start in recovery mode
that cannot-stop-automatic updates
pretty sure that happened to my parents
it does
be patient
it's 3047 now
it's super bloated with symbols
i get it now
because you are dumb
what happened
2014 i think
u mean stkc?
that's not real
yikes indeed
6s is better
and it's apfs v1
to having it
cuz we go from nonexistent codesigning
mitigation
1 to 2 is the biggest
i think that has stuff
the cpu can't be broken
it does print characters on screen so
well we are trying another path on ios 15
rootlessjb3 and 4
it does
ipad 2 ios 4.3
and yes that's shitpost
you probably shouldn't be trying sandcastle which has never worked well
for that
pongoos doom
but you are better off with
chocolate doom
you can run doom
like that
it has some drivers but nothing
touch work on 13
well you can interact if it is linux-sandcastle
sandcastle
on ios 14
you can't touch
android is linux distribution
that one is easier
use linux sandcastle
put phone into dfu mode
or ipod touch 7
don't
untether
doesn't
siguza
noone
^ clyde
people with 17 digit ids are good
218213049381683200 don't even know what im talking about
"i want untethered jb now"
man just said
would hang stuff for quite a bit during boot
cicuta_virosa in an untether
you do realize
i can't help people that are too "stoopid"
ya know
a backup of tweaks
a list is not
and again
le what
ios 14.7.1 is dead
only if you perform a restore
iphone os
because 11 is so bad
nah ios 12.0 good
more reliable background signing
^ this better than altdaemon
and mess with camera in unlocked devices
or note 7
what were you expecting
it's  a not-so -efficient pc game on a phone
unlike some crappy androids
ios has good thermal throttling
minimalize on
that's filtered
and custom apps
together
when can we say `minimalize` and `on`
it's for custom ringtones
when there are no mingw arm64
tsschecker for windows arm64
how am i supposed to compile
windows ass
and get banned for no reason
which could make people caught up
respring
:yes:
rip trop
i mean packages that are references but have no installation candidate
virtual packages would show in sileo
and needs to userspace reboot
your device ran into a problem
safe mode
imagine being transphobic
you use sticker id
and pls don't run file on it
it is written on this "image"
read it
what is it
`sbinutils` wen
i just need to have an overclocked to hell cpu
gcc and clang doesn't need gpu
because i use intergated graphics
what is a 1060
what 1060
i had
telnet google.com
21.9 k stupid people
don't go to google.su
why not just say 14.8
loool
well a flat that is
buy a house
mem one should be filter level 4
you will need that
running clang on laptop
idk i try to keep my phone constantly charged
dmca that is
there are no excemption for those but doesn't mean it's illegal
and bridgeos
not for homepod
ios 7.1.2
iphone 4
chinese icon themer
on app store
i think a long, long, long time ago there is actually an icon themer
just mdm your own device
i need backgrounding
u don't use themes?
~~so i can waste 6 hours a day on procursus~~
because good hardware
i can't
old people
what sethc
cmd in login screen
osk.exe is on screen keyboard
on school pcs
it is very much educational
actually
(it boots to tty)
right before a lesson
also put linux in ramdisk booted up
and set it auto boot windows in 1 second
i put linux on classroom pcs
before exam
copy down the exam answers
you should
how much drug
how would you fix that
the boobs would get rejected
the school staff aren't very tech savvy
and they aren't even signed into icloud
don't use mdm
my school
that's ios 13.3.1 btw
also i used u0 because i absolutely need exploit success rate
jbapps
no i used
been there, have done that
jailbreaking school ipad
jitterbug vpn launch
tethered launch
too many packages
binutils moment
that'd be bootrom + baseband rom + seprom + all microcontroller code execution exploit
to activate
use itunes
well since it is ios 12.5 something in the hardware is broken
panties.moe
rip you can't download taurine from there anymore
unzip that
hi triangle
and it's a debug build with symbols
github actions
it just doesn't work obviously
manticore github has manticore ipa
!repo opa334
imma take that pls wish me good luck
iso 69 jelbrek
need it
high life has idiot moments???
idk maybe
no im going to sileo #talking-behind-backs-of-people-private-chat
slightly
oml imma go to sileo server
iboot on ios ignores these values
iboot ignores nvram boot-args=root-live-fs=1
doesn't work like that
well you can't load custom ramdisk untethered
oh that
2. you need to defeat pac + ktrr for that
because it's the original kernel
you still won't be able to boot in unjailbroken mode
you don't
with checkm8
you can
cuz iboot checks for that
just recovery loop
technically you won't bootloop
not even bootloop
if you delete 0s1, it can't find it and will send you to recovery mode
but good enough
well snapshot of volume is not the same asa different volume
but also isn't at the same time
well the new volume method kinda is rootless
~~nick chan should be the standard of normal~~
but won't work as ipa
it might launch
and zip that and rename extension to ipa
rename loader.app to payload
loader.app on a12
but useless
technically yes
and that forces
google
amyh3lix (that's real btw)
untaurine
odysseyc0ver
doesn't filter this
yes because filter
you can't say minimalize and on together
at 8 am
welp im outside
rick made people 10 second dev
paid by somebody else
and all my tweaks are
(well copylog is paid by someone else)
idk rick pay for almost all my tweaks
you can't deny that
free tweaks are under 1.38
xen html
free tweaks
pls completely ignore the fact that im a whitename for the last minute
tweaks are not required
because
don't install cydia from checkra1n app
also perhaps you can remove caps lock
does checkra1n says all done
appsync unified
looks like bootstrap upload failed
:sftuflower:
dynamic window manager
not a vm obviously
`uptime`
imma buy c0ver.dev
meanwhile the filter can't properly filter invite
and now this
checkra1n usb happened
lol which filter is being triggered
hayden does
that's the question
hows hayden advanced dev
anyways
more like couldn't read english
nvm admins can't give admin
it's gone
doregon dev role
yoooo
dev role
!t noob
like this
sending
messages without
so many
possible to
ok so
need 100000 messages for member one
not "soon"
that would take about another 6-7 hours
aight i compiled for 1500 now onto 1600
not checkra1n
well checkm8 is
not 3 years
also it's only 8 months
there's no leak in a12
that's a13
t8015 and below-
yes but not a12
high life more like hyper life
nah that's be admin abuse
that are actually on the internet
hes not the first one
crane again
because non-jb
~~september 30th watch out~~
crane is good
crane
get copylog
he just said any jailbreak

trash
u0 log since v5 is just
need ios fortran compiler
dpkg-deb: error: 'paranmat' is not a debian format archive
and richard g
who is adam tunnic
doregon is stoopid
because it is like that when first booted up
probably
and now i compile 1500
well i compiled for 1700
12th hour of compiling binutils ffs
binutils is 100 packages bro
man fr'd himself
cuz im going ridiculous on that
in the context of procursus
in binutils
daily reminder that only like 15 targets is actually needed
cuz im literally frying my pc compiling binutils
i am basically finding all the targets that exist
cuz i added a bunch of targets to binutils again
at this rate
run start_mac.sh
for long enough
to make sure peoole hold down buttons
and in order to dfu device must be connected
yes it's slightly different
you can
!t dfu
restore mode is the restore ramdisk
restore mode doesn't happen in checkra1n
balls
!t noob
the start_mac.sh that is
!t dfu
get info dfu mode
i see sileo
you did
install odysseyra1n
yeah said it
on amd laptop?
sounds legit
(still worse than intel)
that more likely to work
use that
that has higer chance to succeed
if you have amd mobile devices (laptop)
actually it's fine if the ports are directly connected to the motherboard
because usb controller
also you better use the ports on the back of the pc
!t reboot
and intel is better for checkra1n
you can try the ports on the back of the pc
then it might work
retry 1000 times
what pc cpu
cuz that should never take longer than 2 seconds
the readme.txt assumes people have basic scp, shell and c compiler knowledge
there's a readme.txt file
reboot
amfid moment
for sandcastle
there's instructions in the downloaded file
offical sandcastle instructions
just use
said something incorrect
i just
no write support that is
there's no apfs support
cpu rendering
cydeo
well...
on 14
is half broken
sandcastle
you don't
more like a wm
fluxbox isn't a real de
i think nathan got xfce to work
and x11
linux-sandcastle ships with chocolate doom
run doom
android-sandcastle does
linux-sandcastle don't need jailbreak
linux-sandcastle works on ibridge 2 i think
yes, all devices with cpu yes
ipod touch 7
and moira modules
and some icon themes
downgrade to 14.7.1
actually can downgrade to 14.7.1
unless 14.7.1
you don't
real?
if you don't know
well the "amd64" iso will work in most cases
or arm64?
or i686?
it works
already tested
where
futurerestore windows aarch64
binutils.mk takes an eternity to compile
building binutils
one thing is packaged as multiple packages
spitting packages
because of the splitting
than people think
and procursus has less stuff
idk but binutils has 95 packages
!t checkra1n
actually not technically, but literally
technically it supports t2 as well
not exploit
that's a vuln
just modify the pin policy
me uploading binutils:
aka the filter would be worse
!t girdead
ah yes hayden seay madman made everything
3 people 4 reactions
to 90 packages
something needs to split
just play servers
it does but not ios 14.3
odysseyra1n
everyone said it's working
and on that a9x checkra1n bugtracker issue
to get it allocated over the nand stack
and you can trigger it by reentering dfu 4 billions times
and there are no overflow check on a13
the boot selector increase by one on ebery dfu entry
it's just
there's a memory leak on a13
on a13
a memory
there's
technically yes but no
not sex
installbruh
i have multiple reports of it working
just use the custom iso
undefined symbols for architecture arm64
idk that has some strange url path
go to 10
thing is with pojavlauncher
what going wrong with exit called within libsystem_c.dylib
i still didn't know
openjdk-8-jdk
openjdk-8-jre
!t checkra1ncli
as rootfs
union mount also broke
kpf  also broke
that in itself doesn't prevent checkra1n jailbreaking normally
they changed the iboot string
no it isn't
outdated
now hook lhhookfunction
!t eta
also the invite is now procursus
coolstar isn't
somehow we don't enforce version depends strictly
because
otherwise you will end up with messed up packages
well you should
with that repo
and it replaced the entire sources
i was adding a repo
basically
today
except that it messed up my sileo.sources
cydia but better
checkra1n app
install cydia
you don't
microsoftfr
this is not fr ^
it's darker in here
changed significantly
idk the pfp hair colour
why not ntfs
where copyright doesn't exist
in discord search
and somehow cercube ipa is allowed here (?)
to make it work
you need to actually patch the ipa
and bsds probably
only on linux
doesn't really work on windows
square root of five plus one then divided by two
jtv pls come back to life
because each new feature is an attack surface
then arguably there will be more jailbreaks
if they add more features
we just don't talk about that
there is
so 2.5
basically cs + pwn + some random jailbreaks that pops out time to time
!t eta
a new jailbreak
if you count each u0 major ios version
about 2.5
ipad 2 ios 4.3 jailbreak
and im still waiting for
it's random
right now
do you ever see me typing
a question
probably not
ios 14 moment
ok, but -p is fastest
and it would make stuff appears being frozen
too slow
what did you do
who is that
but acorn exploit yes
i said untether exploit not untether jb
there's a reason
publicly
ios 11
there's untether exploit on
idk all my stuff is on github
need a genius to add it back
wait dm
some anime character
a piracy thing used the name of something else
there's also false positives because
well yes "checkra1n usb"
it's about making some piracy stuff whose name is a substring of "unc0ver" to get "unc0ver " filtered
and get it into the filter
piracy stuff called 0ver
someone need to make
i know
a substring of that is piracy
well that doesn't filter anymore
checkra1n usb
a bunch of school pc
i also copy cmd.exe osk.exe
and i just went with linux usb everywhere
when school blocks everything but does not block boot selector
when school blocks cmd but not bat files
android apps
can't you run
big oof
and not on mips linux either
just not checkra1n
it's possible to do checkm8 on windows
ipad pro 9.7
also if you scroll all the way to bottom the member list will move by itself
sileo managed to mess up sileo.sources today
omg  discord vnc viewer sucks
hayden can
and saily is 1
1 or 2
they only do
true they don't include like 10 4-clause projects
odyssey does not install cydia
so they definitely violated
so at least *some* of those are ads
aight
they don't use that license anymore
well, that's arguablely a poorly defined thing in the license
saily devs be like: can we see in court now
what is an 'advertising material' and what is not
but they don't
if they are lazy they can just make bots to append to everything
when airpower gets released
that's one colour only
it's an image
no it's tar.gz.png
solid colour
:stfumohamed:
zebra
hook functions
libhooker-android
libhooker sounds about right
trying cursed stuff rn
because it's only wwtc
is good
aaron's yt
with exactly the same name
because there is piracy tool
7:30 am
i hate the filter imma go to sillyo server
member one is not level 4 appearently
level 1 is not
level 2 and 3 is good for a lot of stuff already actually
and what is 1 2 and 3
also i mean filter levels
what are the level 4 and 5 roles
when eta context probing in filter
filter not good bro context unaware
that's some anime character name
ok but
dsc-nuker_1.0_all.deb
lol pls it doesn't detect my rm -rf prerm deb
:trollface:
install_name_tool
ipapatcher i think
or kloader
for deca5
or iphone 4s
unless iphone 3gs or something
plot twist: he means haywire
parcility moment
free??
sudden userspace reboot soon after boot
boot hangs for solid 60 seconds
that isn't very good
cicuta chained with untether exploit will create effects
14 only i think
the real question
wen eta jtv come back to life
it would just take 4.29 billion reentries ez
i have 25 open prs
not having 14.3 blobs moment
wait let me diff the sdks real quick
is updated in some way
the sdk
a8 dfu nonce collision
shitc0ver
bsodyssey
bruh indeed
i seldom miss class
nvm i misunderstood something
background location
:dead:
all the roles beside apple executives are unpinned
if you are talking about that iphoneos-arm thing
bot apt and dpkg needs patches
shouldn't those be dpkg patches
what apt patches
libhooker can work jailed
already worked on 15
well that works on 15
between 14 preboot and 15 preboot
there are differences
sileo demo does
and then maybe installer
sileo and zebra can survive ios 15 i think
no lol
lemme load a ko
actually
exec format error
equivs?
brb installing on amd64
cringe!
~~find another bootloop mobile config~~
a13 boot selector leak is cum
a11 is broke
and mitm the requests
why is there no delay ota blob saver
works with ios 15 sep
ios 14.3
prison break
what is this
(some people has to ask so as to show that there are interest)
which is not the setup of this community
the more begging you do the less likely anything will get released
in a lot of programs
ive seen m1 macos 14.3
macos 14.3 leak!!!
be something added into the sdk
there must
does that matters
tried to kill it then
there must be a leak somewhere
i've kept discord desktop open for 1 week and it's now using 1.7 gb ram
that isn't autoexec
to bypass the domain
what is jtv site ip address anyways
diffing stuff
why all apple executives
~~ask apple to remove it~~
that is not bypass
how to bypass activation lock screen? i'm on ios 14.7.1 iphone xs max!
springboard.ipa
also that setup is for a13
heap is completely deterministic in rom
just to get a suitable leak
the worst setup would require reenter dfu 4 billion times
a7 isn't the wordt
from other checkm8 varients
because a7 checkm8 is different
actually
probably
should i accept a friend request
it's fine
to be absolutely sure
now reboot
that could mean that it boots
need remount+reboot test
root_hash.img4 exists on 14
in 14
partially implemented
it's already
what if it breaks rootfs
has ssv
inb4 ios 14.8
amfid bypass and then jump straight to jbd without thinking about coretrust
then you can be coretrustless
needs ldid -ksigncert.p12 -s everything
procursus
for some binaries
taurine uses a signcert.p12
on the backside
and it's ugly
well i already listed some
in the bootstrap repo
taurine has more stuff
just masked  by 'u0 bad so it bootloops a lot'
not rarely
persona.kb bootloop does happen on u0
1. getting discriminated in this discord
have more issue with u0
you will
is the best
checkra1n with odysseyra1n
no vfr and rfr

!t eta
we still got this
libhooker hooking itself
using libhooker
lhhookfunction
can you hook
so yeah patching dyld doesn't seem all that unrealistic
on kppless so just do thing there
you kinda have to patch process spawning already
patch it
which exists already
and do stuff in pspawn payload
just patch dyld
like?
is the only thing that's of any significance there
os-release
approve it
those are nothing
if you know what to put in there
just 'use' apple configurator
you don't even need to bypass anything
anyways
that's hardcoded into the hardware
you can't disable force reboot
is it is most likely not stolen
the critical difference
bypassing screen time
is like
bypassing guided access
well the only jb that works in guided access is checkra1n
preferences.app
you can't if
why rick hate rick
just modify info.plist with plistutil
invalid date entry
binutils update:
they are not being run
ports tree for ios
then let it run for 300 seconds when said device disconnects
'apple mobile device (dfu mode)' that is
for usb device
i can set up systemd on demand
idk if
checkra1n-cli.service
l it's sent
aight email is finished there's 310 words and 2507 characters
on the violation
i have 3 different points
cum cock balls
i will just include the email i think
that's the thing
it's not really false
all right reserved
just thinking if there's more
in commit messages
well i did find an email
gonna send emails to fsf
need more contact information of sam bingner
buy an used ipod touch 7
buy another device
even debian oldstable does better than that
pls imagine using 5 months old bootstrap
but you can enable it ahain
-77 has to do with passcode
no it's real
disable passcode
misc-cmds
ryzen mobile generally has less problems then desktop but
ports on back of pc
use. back. ports. and try 500 times
because the ports are directly connected to the cpu
in addition, amd laptops are also more likely to succeed
if front ports has problems
the back ports are more likely to succeed
cannot read property 'name' of undefined
ubuntu
debian
when you try to have two components
you will run into problems
*it doesn't really work very well*
can't guess that because i don't really speak mandarin
it does kinda sound like that in mandarin
well i see the pronunciation now
and purify
and i know exactly what is kingroot
well can confirm it makes slightly more sense now
"why god still didn't leave 2022 clean pureifydevice highly harmonic"
to have a better translation
but it's too much nonsense
because the input is nonsense that output is also nonsense
super fragile purify voluntarily super teaching meaning rootcleaner harmony system

manticore panicker
manticore jailbreak more like
hack different
why does this goes to
jbexec sauce code image
hey i have launchjailbreak source code
cs should dmca u0 for stealing electra sauce
no we should
he did
apple music android
technically apple has a public linux anisette the data library
also remember to strip off the 40 mb symbols after downloading
altserver-linux
and not renaming daemons like what icleaner does
disabling ota daemon is fine if you do it properly
like hidable stock apps?
the ios 11 part does work
alias manticore='liberios 2'
i mean
that is, when i first saw that image
it's not in this channel earlier
pls imagine leaking messages
options is half visible
checkra1n official does not have iso download so
kjc loader
ends up being ipad 2 ios 4.3 2.0
if what hayden says holds
anyways probreak should release in 2 days
so no injection
and without that binary blobs
it's just
probreak still needs to test iphoneos-arm deb migration
probreak
how bad is that
installd moment
the application-identifier is `cum.cock.balls.manticore`
need appsync
no idea how to port swift stuff
install that ipa
did you
inb4 it does get released but it isn't good and geo argues thst it's blizzard
wdym ipa downloader
almost anyways
it's all geo
was thinking about using org.projectmanticore.manticore but nah
also the the build results are on my fork of manticore
`sudo halt`
it's still official so it's fine
`procfs.kext`
this one
wait wrong image
rip that admin guy
idk why some people are always invisible
i very much are
!t odysseyra1n
checkra1n
iosuckadick
actually yes if you buy another device
keyboard theme
and no didn't block
why split screen for settings
also should be iphone os but ok
very legit
$home is still broken
it is just switched to non-login shell which is the correct move
no i mean
regression moment
!t taurine
fake jailbreak moment
saw that ci file
where is the ci
what deb
already done
more like that
iosuckadick
nsbeingnice
remove any remnants that is
sudo apt purge com.brandonplank.flappybird
easiest solution
delete that package
we don't know if it is redistributed
in addition
that is a open sauce flappy bird clone
you do realize
just remove it
he doesn't know
no it isn't
delete that package
that could as work as well
just delete it
and install it
find the deb somewhere
you just
there's no known deb location of the damaged package
except it does
member one
dm rick server invite
hi flurry
because want to play minecraft java
no, preferences are fun
that's the bsod loop file
persona.kb is a relatively common issue
well it will *work* but won't *fix* anything in that case
not necessarily
it's stuck in kernel mode
changerootfs
how to destroy a process that won't respond to kill 9
before you ask
and won't reopond to signal 9
well it's having tons of context switches
without reboot
stuck in d state
how do i stop a process
technically anyways but it's like half done
dev doesn't know how to make a launchd plist
not at all
well at least visible
you ask him for his photo where he is holding some sort of identity certification and discord tag

no proof
how would he know

the filter literally doesn't work
this is not bypass
a maliciously crafted video
just make it play
nowhere
no filter whatsoever
gir died
there is no bot to abuse right now
there's way to crash gir 100% reproducible
troll
ah yes m word
||now this is not filter bypass it's the filter doesn't work||
||real||
hot indeed
wen saily on procursus tho
add apt
which does make some accounts get caught up
doregon repo does not reach the highest standard
not right now
look at muncher
gm aaron
blocking doregon is dumb
hayden
!t rootfscli
nyhc face reveal wen
still more than elu
because procursus split packages
procursus has *less* stuff than people think
sam bingner snappy
snappy on procursus
troll
make it like iphone app on ipad
disable ipad support
can you try
xcode simulator
unless
buy another one
1st gen
jelbrek it
pov: noone in the dev team has an ipad
prefix and sub prefix
at least
and compile flag would make sense here
well uicache will handle that
lol got snappy on procursus
its ios 12 bootstrap on ios 10 so
use u0 method
!t rootfscli
use apt
no it's ios 12 bootstrap on ios 10
google
ios 10 has apfs (v1)
need compiled amyh3lix ipa
but stuff enough to get a fancy terminal going
ofc there are exceptions like chromium
(need custom kernel most likely due to ram)
that is compiled for i486 too
although alpine technically can also work
and it's gentoo
iirc 32 mb ram
someone attempted linux 5.8 and it does work
technically anyways
newest linux runs on 486
**swap**
this works on everything and is basically sbreload:
use ubuntu iso
`sbreload`
why send segfault
sbreload
that's technically optional
use actual distro iso than
it has uefi
if it has secure boot
hey memplus
that emulates an iphone 6s
iphone 6s
no smp
xnu-qemu-arm64
iphone os 12.1
or sometimes go straight to apt because it's much smoother
i use apt when sileo shits itself
man phone more than 20 times more powerful than laptop
wen gtk1
itself
doc but no gtk
to be fair for such an old system should use a wm instead of actual de but i always think this is too complicated for people
you upgraded that
actually it's 11
mr. illegal instruction says hi
so you could say that is 8086
compatible
well technically a modern amd64  chip is also 8086
all correct
so your laptop is: i386 i486 i586 i686
the actual architecture of your laptop is i686, which is a superset of i386
you just do
because it well it could be a friend invite
they can't actually just filter all friend-invite
the thing is
put guild invite id into friend invite url
name: and author: aren't real fields
because it's unknown
also got all sorts of other dyld errors
a12 power
the latest snapdragon chips are like
compared to others
remember apple arm chips are god tier
twickd still works for me
a14 can probably get 120 fps
60 fps i think
a7 can get 8-10 fps i think
you can dump the ringtones
pretty much unless you are on a security research device
why can't altstore accept the terms smh
ill just demo
thinking about whether i should send relationshiptype 1 to flower and nebula
send me
no these use iap
u0 is not epic
another unpatched exploit
no that's
to router
just connect the pc
don't use u0
illegal instruction
shorter
killall -4 springboard
based on doregon's last sleep schedule
just a 6 hours offset
why app store
pls admin abooz and give doregon dev role
soon enough
screenshot
that technically doodle over taurine
we all know that this is best jb
how's it
run ubuntu 20.04 on iphone
then it would have good performance
unless you use rd-*
well ios 10-11 will need more patches
and a7 on ios 10 has more free ram
remember a7 ota downgrader
probably possible
20-30 messages up
when multi thread, qemu
linux arm64 in vm gives more correct emulation
just negative performance
technically there's utm
well utm but you get negative fps
technically there's an android emulator
bruh...
"restore environment starting"
plz test on ipad
when at that time
safari could crash
opening a bloat enough website and
although that's one of the last one that i unloads
including springboard
and i keep unloading stuff
memory leak
at the end it's just a device with 93% memory usage with springboard unloaded
just keep it up
i had 73 days on 14 before
about 20 days
reboot ipad everything feel so smooth now
that message is quite descriptive
(on ios 14)
imagine using cydia
or another jelbroken device
fr with android phone
downgrade with android phone
14 is bad
a type of device
for extended sileo testing
need iphonesimulator-amd64 bootstrap
'x-unique-id': 'balls'
bothered to update cydia for ios 15
imagine samual bingner
i can't
no touch id because no passcode
when nosep
technically apps can still request a touch id scan
that's a fake site anyways
i can create it too
that's a directory name
`apt info youtube-dl -a`
how 2 crash newterm confirmed:
then sileo
it's much faster to queue them up in apt
if you have a list of 50 packages to install
apt is smoother
such as?
no not zebra
that doesn't even work
also don't use app admin
the background
that's actually taurine
there's ota update daemon
well maybe not
because ota updates
and most definitely can get the nonce
preferences does not have root
taurine is a partially open source ios 14-14.3 jailbreak
terminal
a lot of these are not actually tweaks
!t noob
real people uses offical confusables.txt from unicode
and parent directories stuff like that
which will cram characters together into one
theres also zero space joiner
because some cyrillic alphabets happens to look exactly the same as latin
it usually involves cyrillic replaces
n is a n word
no is a n word change my mind
and i don't *need* it in anyway
i personally don't think so
at all
it won't immediately affect anything
first thing in destruction should be overwrite rdisk1 because
disk0 will just recovery loop
overwriting rdisk1 guarantees dfu loop
to overwrite rdisk1 then
no way
this should still work
without a  lot of stuff
ik how to spawn a shell
mte less
to inject stuff like that
there must be a way
debugging inherently means modifying memory in some way so
can't you just set cs_debugged on everything
in somewhere i think
i pretty much summarised what the binary patches needed are
with some binary patching
well maybe some stuff could
no it will be gone in ios 15
rip dynastic
on ipad
well devhelper is useless
need arm64e procursus bro
compiled for arm64
and yes that's the checkra1n devhelper bin
and they only commands that i found are "subscribe" and "unsubscribe"
why not
hmmmm
lpe eventually moment
!t chart
"under"
not real
!t fr
ok its exit 1
what is the tss checker exit code when attempting to save blob for an unsigned version?
for extended periods of time stock
message search is a 404
on not-autotss
to save blobs
it takes a solid 60 seconds
but sileo has some  assumption that isn't necessarily true
coreutils isn't bugged
no actually
but it isn't anymore
coreutils that's bugged
and icleaner renames it
sindle
`  -d, --directory               download remote directory recursively instead of sindle file`
tihmstar moment
it was at 0%
idfk why my pc monitor is at 100% brightness
then it's fine
autotss in js
just write autotss in js
so technically yes
for bots
idk i uses discord.js
unc0ver
did you have openssh-server installed
nautilis
qt5 makefile
do you happen to have
sometime launchd is dumb
go onto your phone
brb adding them to the table
well a lot of them
ik all of them
to ddos random people
but it doesn't make sense
quite literally nothing except ddosing  with external ip
fix your ps1
it's on demand service
ssh is not a keep alive service
for ssh
idk sometimes launchd is just dumb
wake up the device
because i have random time outs too
ios 14 moment
the ip is not right
but usually
ok but if it takes more than 30 seconds something's off
pretty sure the cpu being hogged by ssh
shouldn't take too long
a little bit
just wait
well debian does has some hot screenshots
debian?
where would you rip them
not like i will install anything from them
it should be 22
wait does sileo respect trusted=yes
obviously
install packages
adam losing more sanity
4k ipsws that is
ssh thw device ip
how is adam pissed
that one is not paywalled either
just rip the control
compare the sha512sums
wireless fr
and firmware
airtag firmware tickets
how do i replay
no last commit is also april i think
an april build
idk someone posted it there
it's in hayden's server
bro hows neofetch deb trusted only
ew zsh
well notable ones in procursus anyways
pov: there are two adams
is the easiest
dualbooting the same version
real!
wel it collided with "the fuck what"
actually it wouldn't bootloop anyways
i don't like insert thing here
i can't see a problem
just completely disable tweak injection into them
depictionkit1
why would it not work
setting everything to ffffff is the best taurine theme
set launchd memory limit to 1 mb
iphone os
when can i convince alpha to sifn the repo
tell them to sign
admin
generalize everything
general i think
sileo hourly
k wait
and send the crash log
pretend that it's an actual crash
send kill -6 to sileo
wget it into usr local bin
rm -rf brew
maximum trolling
a lot of them are gssc packages
i have 627
sileo nightly
just use
none of the openbsd, system v and nextstep targets compile
yeah i might to msys2 binutils
frfrfrfrfrfrfrfrfrfr
by having msys2 in binutils
well i can have like 2 extra pakcages
because windows sucks
excpet msys2
cramped every target that compile into binutils.mk
i just
which repo has binutils
is to have the owner refresh it for you
to have it refresh
the only way
half ded

you don't need that
speaking of those files

these aren't even bundles

that's the dangerous file

it just
it worked
is it mobilegestalt
did i miss something
don't run jetsamctl -l 1 springboard
backrunner flat out respiring loops
with overb0ard
in background
even if pojavlauncher is hogging memory
it doesn't happen
bakgrunnur would causes frequent safe modes
only want a few apps
that's dumb
not *every* app
and i really need a backgrounder tweak
you are giving them attention
so unless all of them are down it will be fine
in taurine
convince coolstar to ship mirrors.txt
now make taurine do that
don't use unc0ver but procursus is dead right now
unc0ver moment
procursus rsync failed again as expected
on checkra1n
don't use the checkra1n bootstrap
untusted
more snow than mt, everest
and it would look like the u0 theme
a mountain
over 20% death rate ffs
i should go onto k2 and take a photo for taurine
than odyssey
well it's a deeper colour
liking this atm
idk can't find it with binwalk
id like to have the black u0 theme actually but i can't find that anywhere
repo died
untaurine!!
ffffff
what did i do
from the app
idk how to extract the dark theme
sounds about right
on 14.3
unless you find one
rsync
well different repos syncs with apt.procurs.us at different times
it goes to procursus first
that's at least 100000 lines
with tmux
well i managed to make newterm surivive a procursus bootstrap build
and run it again
swap the domains in this command
it will
well there are other mirrors
i did
that's in sileo
add dist repo
don't
add distribution repo
you didn't do it correctly
and everything is signed by hayden
replace apt.procurs.us
use a mirror
actually i should try use the buildmanifest method
now if you print 1000 lines it's still ok-ish
type tmux
install tmux in sileo
use tmux in newterm
i got those from adam's api
probably bad buildid
actually
firmware.json
it could be cache

this is important
well u0 11 is open sauce
well electra 2 and u0 11 has similar quality
u0 is only good on these
u0 is only good on

you need resign

how about o3
well i need to log the system calls made by a process
system call tracer
a syscall tracer
where can i find a syscall tracer for ios
and it's very vague
that is not a good reason bro
too ez
looks easy
and all the private keys
get their factoryprivate.pem bro
i have a broken hackintosh too
well it will take at least a week for the preboot strap to roll out
what hack
cpu instructions
still have the instructions
don't use bios
where is the oc folder
also i use a posixly_correct=1 bash
need bash for a couple of things
as default shell
idk i use bash shell on my device
just do it yourself real
they rename an existing snapshot
everything
that is
until stuff removes itself
pretty much
sudo apt purge '*' technically but don't do that
it's just very different vs even more different
launchd is more like systemd then sysv (still very different from systemd)
it's like
launchctl exists
testflight
just use jitterbug
apple calls ktrr "kip" appearently
not saying that not having it is not cool
i bet you have it

you can just create an oauth2 app that reads all your message via rpc and write it onto a file and authorize yourself

stuff still injects into daemons
some sort of device
just use fmi to enable passcode
even if you reboot

ah yes 0 kb
that looks like bootra1n
there's no right or wrong
there's also coloured whitenames

and note that it doesn't say release
bet you didn't see anyone on research_arm64_t8101 device
a7 and a8
only u0 works on that particular situation
which is not important when you are bootstrapped
because it still exist even if the bootstrap upload fails
because xnu bug
and list file in it
but you can cd into it
not listed
it's just that it is not listed
it does
for jailbreak detection bypass
also checkra1n.dmg are often deleted
i mean
well to java depends
it works fine
try again
enable verbose boot
this checks for procursus
just read
chimera?
and why drop bingner bootstrap? because it is dragging our leg
chimera 1.4 and lower
chimera bootstrap means
chimera does not use chimera bootstrap
drop chimera and bingner bootstrap support
raid phrase
unc0ver
chimera
scam moment
ah yes raid where all accounts are mempro
the spam ping mute is dumb
someone should add this to procursus
because it do rwx jit
or otherwise you are going to be trying 999 times
but on amd your usb ports should be directly linked to the cpu, but not to a separate usb controller
unless the usb controller is directly connected to the cpu
probably
you need to try 1000 times for checkra1n
just be super sure this is not a laptop right?
so you really don't have usb?
that's another person
don't think that has anything to do with rule 5
!t yt
but uh you need to install actual linux if you have no usb and yes that can be done without usb
think you have to do a full linux install if you have no usb
and dvds
also you can cds
what ios version
doesn't work on ios 4
ipad 2 ios 4.3
that was jailbroken in 2018
you don't
or just don't write on the rootfs at all
and there's no rootfs remount here
use another fs as the rootfs
you can just
you don't need rootfs remount for a writable rootfs
because stuff often ignores cpu speed when adjusting resolution
and it won't even lower the resolution by itself
and it just shutters
that moment when you have enough internet speed but your device can't decode the video in real time
openssh
that expired on april 26
change in behaviour
because
remember to save boobs!
think it's in how to save blobs
!t blobs
sanity_check cameren#0420
if itunes recognise it then it is real
then it worked
the dpkg thing
alpine
you find it by putting sudo -i into terminal
you need to use root terminal
root shell
dpkg --configure -a
a person
pov: you can't steal this sticker
what does jailbreakd do
that vm sucks
crappy vms be like:
how come there's no delayed ota blob saver
where you can just figure out how to invoke the compiler directly
unless that node native modules has like 1 or 2 file there's literally no way to make them work now
-isysroot iphoneospro.sdk
then node native modules are ultra hardcore mode
if python modules are hard mode
isn't it building from sauce
nah there's some stuff that's going to make it work
which doesn't exist on procursus
and i think it's libjpeg-dev
complain to maintainer
all startup repairs fix is persona.kb

pojavlauncher
how do i debug
and there is no log
need to debug a crash on launch
with debugserver
how do i launch pojavlauncher
iphone 12
real people uses tar.xz
anything that contains a macho should have libiosexec1 depends
with proper depends that won't happen
and libiosexec1 is not strictly enforced in depends as well
we did not enforce it strict enough in depends
and it caused issues like this
at least on windows 10
no need to install
bash broke
probably
you need to have ssh
so to fix that
which broke bash
libreadline broke
no it's something more serious
save 2 second
just ctrl alt delete
need restore rootfs
!t taurine
don't use unc0ver
the hungarian one
no i mean
toilet cat is dead
looks no
compared number of bytes of source code
developer
now we all knows that doesn't actually ping
??????#7660
that's banned so doesn't count
everybody knows you should always donate to a advanced developer that has 550 warnpoints
negative warnpoints are cool
when -50 warnpoints
you need power supply
get an admin to join foreign movement
aight
hello person that i don't know very well either
hi amy
you need to flip the page permission in kernel memory page table
pojavlauncher.ipa
then you are not
get a pc
kek  broken indicator
just delete persona.kb
just use prerm smh
and haywire moment
watchos moment
!t nopc
an illegal operation
it's just
technically not malformed because the syntax is correct
just call execvp on a directory
it doesn't even have to be a shell
taurine 1.0.2 is terrible
and another time is
basically i have an extra space in a shell script
aka nick chan's code
ive bootlooped from first party code
id say millions
now of course rip battery if you took everything to that extreme
with no way to prevent it so
the phone will just shut itself down
at some point
to be fair the hw is quite hard to break from that
which is probably 80 or something
i want -1000 warnpoints
masterofmike

well there's one extra
you said what im gonna to say

the version numbee is different

sometime in hack different

and appearently it's not as simple as people think
i think i talked to siguza about that
pretty sure lighting ipads and newer iphones can be usb hosts
nevermind it's happy birthday
that's a member one dev
how about kirb
how about whitename dev
is whitename++
nitro booster
and this is (ab)used to achieve jit complication
ios disables the enforcement of codesigning in memory
when an app is debugged
since debugging inherently means that modifing instructions in memory
a debugger
also it's a sandboxed app
well i mean it isn't too hard if you just say it is "on device debugger" and don't mention jit
jitterbug
well it got past testflight review so
and yes there's always a risk
thing without paid dev account
and it's absolutely required for that vpn
and i think it's fine
in utm discord
owner also has sent that link multiple times
the owner doesn't seem to hate it
of it being bedrock
it's not defending its point
doesn't matter
to f3
to world
to menu
from pojavlauncher
use that to show it's java
just f3
actually
that will invalidate that argument
and send entire itunes backup
you can jailed if ur dumb
now of course that's only a problem on 16 gb ram device which couldn't run it yet
don't think you need more than 2 gb ram allocated if you are not going crazy with stuff
com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit
isn't we at 1.3 development
auto overb0ard?
looks fine
think it support ios 9
it's more complicated to launch but still no pc in the launch process
you should
can confirm it doesn't work
and don't mention the jit thing at all
just say it allows developers to debug apps when they are outside
disable code signing enforcement in memory
on device debugger no jb
and  enter 127.0.0.1 as device host
yes it's advertised as on device debuuger smth like that
jitterbug has testflight
just use the testflight version
take advantage of the wifi router upnp
without pc no jb
it is possible to resign with wifi
coloured whitename moment
let's not ignore u0 has their own issues
just use 'it'
nsdick moment
bsod is flawed we need kexec
taurine is just chimera1314
a mount point
also odysseyra1n is the best
nitro and beta only
wen ireverse proxy
it just makes the device thinks that it is surprivised by null
why can't we replay sep tickets
with a higher sep
install openjdk-jre
`strings checkra1n | grep -i copyright`
checkra1n on term=vt100 is fun
nevermind that json does not have altserver
or rip it from the json
i got what you mean
wait nevermind
he already did
id give 1% chance for that
and ipsws are zips
ive helped someone using that
not on i686 linux
who is mfer
i think yes
if you are wondering
also this is completely off-topic
i only talked about cortex-a53
since when im talking about a5
some 64 bit arm cpu
the specs are 1.6 ghz * 4 i think?
and it takes forever
cuz i tried to build procursus on that thing
i mean
it isn't
currently using some sort of device with that chip
cortex-a53 chip sucks to hell
it's unsupported.
just use it on your phone
why bother using idevicerestore on mac
or  buy an newer one on specific versions
because you want jailbreak
because you want jailbreak
there's tweak that reimplements some of the youtube premium functions
there's no tweak that give you way one of these
and im still waiting for someone to give me -1000 warnpoints
buy another device then
then stop asking
since it sounds easy according to you
consent
without
or ios 5
i know someone has ios 6 procursus
actually just ask someone else to do it
so i can restore an android device on ipad
time to compile it
crypto miner
well for the most part
they are a profile they can't actually do a thing
now remove them
such as use an iphone to restore an ipad
also just use device a to restore device b
people that don't resign apps themselves are dumb
without a pc
have two jailbroken devices and you are good
arm64e moment
that wouldn't work
just tether boot
365 days

too lazy
cuz they are stupid
real?
pass -c option on cmdline
and an ios 8 one
i think he has ios 6 bootstrap
nathan has it
iphone 4
is that ios 7
appleinternal moment
boot loop
especially since a dmg is a compressed format
and ramdisk shouldn't be this big
pongoos max upload size is 127 mb
but not some python scripts
want to make sure you have the actual pongoterm
what's your mac screen
you need to make one
without the actual disk image
to boot ssh ramdisk
what do you have
make sure you have a ramdisk.dmg file
format
ramdisk should be dmg or img
show it
what does it shows just want to be sure
do help
so you are in pongoterm
ok so uh you are on macos
i think yes
if you just want a ramdisk
don't think so
no you use checkra1n but have `checkra1n -pvve`
pongoos has xnu_ramdisk command
pongoos to boot ramdisk
why don't you just use
did you enable verbose boot
connect fone to pc
you try to ssh
ssh ramdisk
dump the entire disk1 onto your pc
ssh ramdisk exists
procursus is the best source
nice utm_medium
theres an untethered exploit on ios 11 i think
oh and coolstar actually isn't there
saying that coolstar is not in procursusteam
use another apple id
and i saw a -39 downvoted

that's the thing
killed 9 i think

unionfs in xnu is bugged to hell
and the tmpfs union mount is gone as well
after reboot
yeah it's fine
just reboot and it will be fine
i messed with mounts
and it's a remix
nah nah nah
mounted a tmpfs union overlay on rootfs
did crap with mounts
the entire vfs is emptied
although i can cd into that fine
on checkra1n
ask apple
unless
there's literally no way to actually remove it
even  "bypass" doesn't remove it
and use the disconnect method
ew just use 0.12.1
`this kernel requires an i686 cpu, but only an i586 cpu is detected`

i will see if theres some hidden elements

how to use odysseyn1x on surface pro x sq2??????

well powersn0w does not support a7
but it's much harder to get there
actually ios 15 beta 5 iphone 12 srd is worse
wait actually
or ios 15 beta 4 iphone 12
worst combination is no jb
no you are not fucked
"nfr mining corporation hq (usa)" - google maps
that moment when it mentions shady stuff
and don't install cydia from loader
you thought me was typing
i don't like typing
that's the solution
don't use etcher
"only"
actually only 133 gb
well not quite
my procursus folder is larger than that
because they are all implemented in userfs.framework
probably missing a kext to be loaded or something
pretty sure ipados 14 supported fat
how come is filesystem msdos not available
i realized there's no mount_msdos on ios a few hours ago
14 is fine just no hx-touchd
because i can still use ssh for everything i need to
that moment when my hackintosh mouse broke after updating bios but since never bothered fixing it
what distro did you try
just use non-free
someone must though it is ecid
this is what i needed to know
all right
in particular is it all red
apple mailing list
id say yes
daily begging
bindfs sucks on ios
so everything goes to 404
just reinstall newterm 2
ok im done here
or the stock crash log but that sucks
you need a crash reporter to debug that
everything crash?
it's 3:03 am
hayden said idk
it doesn't read any files
probably not
does it even need
there is no no-container
im dumb
so i have to do it
but it got no userspace handler
and there is `type bindfs`
`mount`
halo michael
operation not permitted
bind mounts
coretrustless jbs are the worst
yeah, and sileo.sources got deleted
taurine = killed: 9 and operation not permitted hell
nano justify paragraph is so annoying that i started to echo plists
cuz i am outside and watchdogd gave up
well i am on 14.3
getting codesign issues
oml taurine is sooo much worse compared to odysseyra1n
itunes restore
you can
20 minutes
i can port gcal in like
imagine hooking uname
and it's a very specific colour
it's taller you can diff between solid colour and no banner
you don't have one
but there is a custom banner
it's not interesting at all
look at my banner
systemversion.plist (don't actually do it)
that 256 mb ddr2 pentium mobile guy

ive helped person worse than this
uefi hacks
all right
wait i forgot one

pojav got frfected
aight
lemme test something
if you have the play doh bruh emote then you are good
just manually modify the user database
iphone 3gs is armv7 i think
polyfill it
armv7 so yes
create user
technically yes
rip cfw.guide
or missing lazy symbol called
inb4 dyld symbol not found
(not light green)
green names are cool
and pinkname
how about orangename
muted
blackname is
how about black role
oh yeah
member plus is just
there's a lot of key rings
it has to handle multiple components of same repo
i mean
sileo 2.2 is nice
ah yes apt of apt
then you didn't agree
with a tweak
bypass it
so chicken and egg
and amfid itself is an userspace executable that needs to be verified
why there isn't a chicken and egg problem with amfid
well not iso obviously
it work 12.1.2 a12 i think
ignore it
sigkill
nope i've tried it just panics
how do you have bigboss public key in the first place
did you plug in device
which has to be checkra1n
you are probably referring to older thing
how do you explain the commits
yeah checkra1n
the git is  updated in may
and it's the most updated in the fork list
and misty has 0.0.6
you do realize this is 0.0.5
where
im trying to fakevar
it's quite obvious of what it is
bindfs be like:
make a tweak that hides images in discord that matches a specific sha512sums
no fr intended
kernbypass on taurine be like:
and it says it needs a few more things but it's not declared in depends:
i might make a deb that does that it's gplv3 anyways
kernbypass ios 14
why can't the dev put some of the steps in postinst
time to compile
i should try nyamisty's fork of kernbypass
because it isn't
that isn't a piracy repo
d state moment
changerootfs ignores kill -9
changerootfs does nothing but hog the cpu
on ios
when there's no key
sileo just doesn't check it
so if you only have one usb port you should use checkn1x
checkn1x is a ramdisk but odysseyn1x is not a ramdisk
this is what happens if you unplug the usb in odysseyn1x
of the same type
buy another device
because you don't have the profile
works on ios 14.3
bootloop profile
ee47edb65b79162383d680abefd43b96fd9e1748abe0d81ff9005deb2aef042e16317dd4c7dd4b8ee89e18d99e93c476ef43b0d0e4fcf39c9af4e6ea8f0cd539  bootloop-me.mobileconfig
what ios version
and what ios version you have
will you install it
you do realize it's an actual bootloop right?
like that
no it's a webclip with a  maliciously crafted icon or something
and itunes update won't fix
very stable
ios 11 - ios 14.4.2
1 year is stable 1 hour is also stable (uptime)
well defined here
although stable really isn't
start a lawsuit
now it isn't actually stable
now rickroll seay
fr chain:
so yeah
that isn't solid proof (yet)
chill guys
playdohbruh is fr microsoft edition
using a phone allows for easier online scamming don't use it
at least get rid of 7 day resign

epic game stuff probably
~~3ds emulator in utm~~
and 14.7.1
so you have blob for 14.6 and 14.7
just use autotss
use snowboard
a8 on 15
ipad mini 4 best
link pls
6s goes to 15
hide the phone
hide it
usually those fridge has a diagnostic usb port
if you can hack into that yes
technically true
well that exist on early  firmwares
ps3 is ppc so
they can
that's a even bigger no unless you somehow get qemu-user to work with checkra1n
technically not 100% no
siguza and hayden
!t taurine
and 6.2.0 is an updated that is supposed to only change the ad, but somehow made it worse
well it is
just use 1.0.4
not bootloop
id say 1.0.4
well they made startup repair
odysseyra1n works too
ipados 14.3 which is also affected by the kerninfo bug
i tested with an a9x device
can you include those custom isos
uhh why no jb 14.7.1
$99 dev account
yes delete all youtube tweaks
the restore ramdisk
should be possible if you do crap with
subcursus
unc0dyssey
odysseyc0ver
taunc0ver
it's not nothing
i should go back to those makefiles instead of shitposting here
also the a*x chips
my a5-a14 device collection be like:
buy an iphone 4 then
buy another device
you couldn't jb anyways
on windows
now compile it
and you need linux to use that link
device
another
usb controller passthrough
well not on windows hosted vm anyways
bcdedit + uefi efi stub exists
in fact most aren't
not all linux devices are pcs
ive been waiting for ipad 2 ios 4.3 jailbreak forever
hows that ages
and the 8 is compiled without x11 support
do note that those on procursus has x11 enabled
and 8 is on doregon's repo
well 16 and 17 is on procursus
just get it in sileo
no i mean
i don't get what you are asking
install cydia from sileo
coreutils
not you
so if it can access your download it's the repo's problem
if the repo is configured correctly
just send sha1("") as the udid header which shouldn't be able to download anything paid
well get rid of libhooker first
sudo unbroke
you don't
now that's cringe
not because it's not possible to make a fake passcode
it's just that there's no tweak
the private thread but ok
i mean
cfw guide is gone
showed how to change arch in dpkg and apt
i already
then you don't need removable media at all
and have linux kernel and initramfs in efi partition
set a uefi entry with bcdedit
use uefi
m1 ipad
you can use checkra1n without installing the checkra1n bootstrap
checkra1n
no, macos
if the su executable is in a non standard location nothing can detect it
safetynet doesn't work like that
the only good ones are appstore++ and c++
++ are bad in general
doregon replied
there's nothing you can actually do with ip lol
checkra.in is real
got flagged
the scam site
ios 14.7 x86_64
change it to true
sileo
did you mention you can sideload without jailbreak
if that works it can be exploited jailed
to replace the original
sideload a modified app
can't you just
!t odysseyra1n
!t checkra1n
that one checks for passcode as well appearently
i think you made yourself a fake passcode tweak
and those are byte offsets
it's just some not-so-random strings at those location
nothing
ld_library_path on ios uhh
formatting
that's from java
a file on root
why is there
disks
put dd and attach2 in a loop
and the vpn is localhost
to intercept my own traffic
so guess
well they are all disk images
did it ping
nice ecid
bruh autocarrot
faster
faster than the previous one
then come back here
find a m1 ipad on ipados 14.3
on ipad
why does it feel so dangerous to work with disk images and filesystems
compiled base bootstrap on device
make bootstrap
yes there's a 8 year memory leak
that means there's a chance for vulnerabilities to be introduced every year
command line
i feel like this ipad's gonna explode
i should try the pongoos siguza sent
all right
how many people can i ping at once
its an iso chat as for right now
not a thread
i mean
i just want a priavte cfw channel
mempro
brb gonna work on ipad make bootstrap
for  the heck of it
i didnt
since march 2020 i think
this is only 25% true
custom firmware
because i need break from those cringy makefiles
i actually help people
nice privacy policy
shitc0ver site
because they want ads
it's the most advanced bootlooping tool
can we filter unc0ver
that isn't copyright
how's the last one piracy
one cannot grant rights that they don't have
technically the developer can specifically allow someone to redistribute without allowing it to everyone in the license
if you use that definition
then i would be pirating over 1200 debs
ew the rules' doesn't make sense either
well so make a better definition
well technically getting coins for free doesn't fit the definition here
just ban without being in server
rule 14
bootloop on stock install and no mdm needed
bootlooping profile
nice underestimation
ive seen someone 83 on discord
ipod touch iphone os 1.1 is jailbroken
also it isn't until 2018
it did
not for real
no one
that would require tweaking jailbreakd which is probably not a very good think to do
well which one is used is undefined behaviour
well that is what *should* be done anyways
bug the repo maintainer to fix it
ok good
and figure out the download link
you need to parse the packages file by hand
you are suggesting piracy
well i can probably connect another device just to flex
what i actually did here is quite obvious
aight
i said nfr so
that works up to 4.3.1 or something
jailbreakme
deca5
what chip is that
and still no jb
well i waited 6 years
checkra1n doesn't support ios 15 isn't because of ios 15 is not out
broke
well that bootloop-me profile i mean
bootloop
camsh
chsh doesn't work
well. someone report it
yes amcc error
ipad decided it's time to panic for no reason
so newterm won't lag at all
at the same time
because there's only so much on the screen
it's absolutely required for newterm to be usable
still working on ipad make bootstrap
because apple-cmds mks don't use build_base
well it's as simple as copying over the libiosexec.h file and add -liosexec linker flag
ipados 14
oml all the apple-cmds needs fixing due to libiosexec
building dpkg on da ipad
aight fixed coreutils compile
android is also a linux distribution
you do realize this works on android right?
permission denied
if not then
that should work right
doubt
how about installer
use the one from telesprhroeo
cydia is good on ios 8 isn't it?
oh i think of age rating
i mean
graceful reboot
ctrl alt del
reboot time
press `ctrl+\`
there
quit checkra1n
ctrl+alt-f1
pangu9
you have to set it using shell otpion
doesn't exist
ios 9.1 sure
i just want make bootstrap to work on ios
apt locales
you probably are looking for this
this is it so
ipad real
ipad real
that's the compile  flag of apt
so there's a max
mod can't warn
:trol:
or mod mute
not muted
the patch
it has the right commands to compile
maybe i should look at their git
actually
i mean bingner has a bin but i don't want to use anything from bingner
i just stubbed xsltproc and see if make bootstrap works
press those keys when the pc beeps after power on
turn it off
they have the best security and less than 100 packages
chariz is underrated
text-cmds
muted admin
all right
i saw an ipad 2 or something
iphone 4
!t checkra1ncli
use checkra1n cli
bug probably
`not supported on ios`
the way this is photographed made it cursed
well i said the answer
but uh you basically has to guess to key or refer to motherboard manual
bios moment
take photo
advanced options
options available are different on different versions
take a photo there
all right troubleshoot
then take a photo as soon as you enter recovery
shift+restart
do normal reboot
then take a photo
that doesn't judge anything
= top of recovery options
you have to go back all the way to root
uefi firmware settings it is
not this one
root of recovery options
`uefi firmware settings`
go to "uefi firmware settings"
go to windows recovery
then shift + restart
go into windows
actually
try f1
less issues
easier
like the bottom part of screen is moving but the top part isn't
newterm does not lag with tmux but keeps bugging out
and i am talking about the memo times
it was possible to compile everything back then
well except a looooonnnnggggg time ago
at any given time there's something broken due to different factors
that's literally impossible
ncurses
kernel_task
tmux u ok?
joshtv , gone
vnc password
who added that
it's obviously a missing depends:
pls use make $(tool)-deps
tfw is github giving me remote rejected
well that's panic is due to the cpus=0 boot arg
it's rootfs corruption so
nevermind i should try the force revert option
welp i just bootlooped myself
no jb
i saw that
classdump dyld
and everything is configured for 486sx
it works in vm
tested on real hw
and the bootloader is isolinux
this is not uefi
and the rest is the bootloader
and the compressed rootfs is like 7.7 mb big
the kernel is 1.1 mb big on that iso
checkra1n itself is larger than 10 mb
lol no
to prove that under 10 mb is possible
i made a 9 mb checkra1n iso
double compress moment
as the iso is smaller
so not compressing them is better
odysseyn1x dev didn't realize that compressing odysseyra1n resources makes the resulting iso larger
well if i got too annoying with the makefiles he would reject
based
wwtc 2021
well that didn't end well
not default
packix
i know hayden does not have
fresh
it looks like you moderately need one
then buy a mbp yourself
corellium isn't that expensive
shortcut made on 12 work 15?
and why does the shortcut not support ios 12
not odysseyra1n
it's odysseyn1x that didn't work
i mean checkn1x has a smaller image so it's less likely to ran into the bad ram
how bad your ram gotta be
on what
you didn't do it correctly
ios 12
you have to use pc to install odysseyra1n on
!t odysseyra1n
well if it works it works
but not an externsl usb controller
on amd
the usb controller has to be directly linked to the cpu
and i don't think most of them has bios password so
just install to home dir
nah they will restore it for you for free
just say it ran out of battery during update and you have no pc
we dont bash whitename we just tell them to delete dyld shared cache
nothing
i need that to build procursus on ipad
libxslt is cring
well cortex a53 itself isn't very fast
oh my good double sending
on arm cortex  a53
on arm coretx a53
discord has terrible performance
nah a bunch of people will.get level 100 sometime in the future
and give it to yourself
make level 100 role
because people are stupid
january 2019 kernel or something
that's like
the kernel
it's like early 2019 or something
latest lts is 5.10
no im not
btw im almost done with bootloopomatic
saurik called checkra1n an exploit
u0 is a virus
get back the mbp
just sign it
just not run unsigned executables
you can run unsigned code is stock ios while being debugged
it's about a11
that would be the ultimate bruh moment
they can do that
well both shortcut and scripts are supported
exactly what you think
standard android
that's a pc for the most part
i wouldn't say all devices capable of running checkra1n are pcs
not without another device
6 hours
limit uptime in restore mode
or any other custom volumes
then it will enter dfu
how would you use the blob
from sketchy sites
but you gotta find homepod ipsw
it's just that no one made those
homepod tweak
don't mind me i have an audioos nodejs bin
google chrome
console.log(042 + 2 === 36)
he has everyone's ecid
sssssssssshshd
works in chrome safari firefox  and nodejs
everyone knows 042 + 2 = 36
why fr
or chimera
iphone 3gs moment
internet archive has dmca excemption
yt reborn is on internet archive
what is a yt-dlp
because it does
there was never a procursus
on github
you don't
which it isn't
saurik called checkra1n an exploit
no because people are poor
but you also need to enroll the device into that account
with zsign in ish shell and host an itms link on localhost
it's like signing the ipa
!t yt
just why
why can't delayed ota be used to save ota blobs
then no
!t blobs
and you need to use ish shell  to zsign and stuff
and it isn't exactly easy
well you need a dev cert for that
and 100 devices of each type
and unlimited apps
where you can refresh every 365 days
or get $99 dev cert
just jailbreak
you can install apps in reprovision reborn
where's new one
cput gives more precise control
powercuff i think
or malware
badrepos.txt
calculator
roblox
!t fr
at least we have
so many useful tags are gone
remix
nah nah nah
ok then stop
even more real
well 14 i think
aight
not everyone knows english
i mean
a 4 doesn't act like this
well you are obviously not 4
20% is still too much of a chance
dyld shared cache
on everything ive tried
1 second is soon 1 year is also soon
6s on 9.1 is the best
at least the xcode sdk does that
this means ios 9
just not obsolete ones
i think
vintage devices on their latest version should be supported
on desktop client it's fine and i can send stickers mobile client
just the client
discord client thinks me i cant speak in cfw guide discussion
ldid -s doesn't work
mach o arm64
.gz can only be one file
jusr not on repo
bingner has busybox
arm cortex a53 sucks hhell
toybox has adduser
i use insert thing here
well not really no but
we need that before we can use it in a sensible way
add vfs in pongoos
how big is linux
do that then
wen eta ! falsepositive
550 warnpoint
i mean
and these two words are way too common
that's triggered by two wards being in the same sentence
i mean
gpg --verify file.gpg file
well it's 550 2 days later
you do realize bans delete messages
by that time there's only checkra1n memo so
i mean
it's a guild,channel,message id
it's very possible
i mean
let's also not forget that it's at 550 warnpoints
that moment when i want to ping a person but pinged 4 people instead
well i predicted that
then that's obviously an appletv problem
`findmydeviced`
`ecidecid`
gzip -9 bro
and is it actually cydia
telnet is smoother than ssh for me
don't blow me up
do you even have
toybox has a whole bunch of commands
yeah but not telnetd
and the telnetd runs on ipad
running telnet on aarch64 linux
there's telnet but not telnetd
toybox has telnetd
oh yeah and you probably want to change the password
so can only be a slave
there's a port
idevicerestore on atv 3
you deleted bigboss
i tried compiling tvos libboost once and that didn't work
never mind it's literally on the screen
where
zoey banned
and get banned for no apparent reason
that kid literally couldn't do anything
the 3 rd one actually has a point
it's basically the same iso that allowed people to jailbreak ios 14.5 before checkra1n 0.12.3 is out
looks like a9x's still broken
to checkra1n 0.12.4
i will update the custom pongoos iso
checkra1n is 2007 software confirmed
duplicate crane itself
too much trolling
tvloader on ipad
no options at all
there's like
that's the problem
how do i make it specify readonly
command -v gpg
cydia is most definitely not smooth
thanks, will force mirror refresh
big?sur
who use homebrew anyways
but there is not monterey dist
also my hackintosh mouse is broke
well it happened once when i actually got the signature wrong
this never happens
update gpg
well it's faster and more granular but has less stuff than homebrew
you didn't sign properly bro
although procursus version is still technically 1.0a1
more like beta
get macos haydenfetch
did i saw something
--target=arm64-apple-tvos
well it shows that
everything is made by hayden seay
compromised
insert hayden seay is an idiot
nah ssh
also it's broke
attach doesn't have attach2
where's the package
there's no attach2
so i am not a body
mount restrictions
`operation not permitted`
bad repo
that's the bad one
that icon in itself isn't piracy but yeah
saw that icons
package list
i can't find anything bad in that tweaklist
where
unless dm spam or something but the reason doesn't mention
not you
so he really didn't do anything i think
well hes muted
i swear there's that white star with blue background package
post the text on pastebin or something
also it's 1:06 am for you i think
keep it as is
somehow it helps although it has no reason to
and verbose boot
i saw his screen recording
sileo
yes i think
he didn't i think
but please jailbreak with safe mode on
you didn't bootloop
on odysseyra1n
you can use cydia
you need to understand that
if you are on odysseyra1n you are also on checkra1n
he has procursus repo
yes he is on odysseyra1n
the icloud backup
delete the backup first
even if it's 11:20 am
now i got to rest
renamed to png
cuz it literally is a gzipped tar
imagine trying to load a gzipped tar as a png
also odysseyra.in is registered
cumra1n.com is $12 on google domains
assass1n.com for $1895
nvm it's $8095 now
great so i need all my savings for that
buy checkra1n.com and redirect it to docs.procurs.us
i mean the actual files are on assets.checkra.in
and why is sandcastle download on checkra1n server instead of corellium's
ipod touch 7
testflight is easy mode because you can have a new build without going through review
can ldid sign dyld shared caches?
also it has a process id of 1
spawn every other userspace processes
that's ipad6,3 i think
seding and grepping stuff right now
if you set lost mode quick enough they still can't do a thing
that error is pretty descriptive
no jb
for http authentication
because apt only has that
well https
does packix support http basic authentication for downloading packages
are you nice
pls explain your nickname
ipad mini 4 is a8
how about a8
never consider sunk cost
is signed
the entire rootfs
im not updating to ios 15
iphone os
then didn't jailbreak until ios 12.1.1
i think i jailbroke ios 7
libhooker is not part of taurine
if you really doesn't like libhooker
just use subcursus
odysseyra1n is the best confirmed
if you don't like sileo - you can install cydia in sileo (not from loader)
here was a bad solution
on default checkra1n 14.7
there's a way to not respiring loop
depending on how you view it it is actually either essential on all version or not essential on all version
!t fr
!t fr
not on a8
also i can't find any data whether cicuta_virosa worked on any of the 14.4 betas
buy another device
uh oh!
ipad mini 4
it can
but it didn't said that
there's no no computer jailbreaks for a8 devices on ios 14.4 either
not fully covered
so it's wrong
ipad mini 4
there's a8 device on ios 14.4
!t latest
it could be styled space
well yeah that's not necessarily strange unicode characters
or `_ _`
eh is it really  unicode
checkra1n
userspace reboot just reboot my device
userspace reboot happens in stock
guy has 256 mb ram and 32 bits linux
you can't write to the block device like that
not really
force_dfu gpio pins
what they should do
bias what
i just say there's an easier way
it isn't hard for someone that wants to have sileo nightly to do
patch that back in
so modify
just modify github actions to upload artifict
not debianized
it's possible that person overwrited that blob
i mean
and llvm toolchain
hayden seay is a madman
out of the bounds read in gir
is that on cfw guide
where
and you can't use thise onboard blobs
a realistic scenario is that it came with 14.3
lowest version  when they first bought device
especially since people are on
it's still important
to say that factory onboards doesn't work
we need
what does it say
idevicerestore -le
also to downgrade to 14.7.1 you need to erase
probably yes
did that work
substitute user
and log in
just choose xfce session
use that
nevermind this is it
actually log back in
and post a photo
log off
probably in makefile
you need to remove the -werror flag somewhere
!t checkra1n
which is the case here
if you have more than one
there should be a drop down menu on the login screen to chosse desktop environment
ios 14.7
just reboot
it's done
that error can be ignored for the most part
my 75 days uptime died because i killed mobilesafari
ipad pro 9.7 wifi
me chilling with 100% battery max capacity on ipad6,3:
because it's like 80% of the time
no jb
and that's like
looks fine to me
os: procursus
technically there's one that only host certs (not apps) be we don't talk about that there
it will get deleted
don't
we did a little trolling
well i said something similar
which can do ota install
$99 dev cert exists
but we don't talk about that
so no that mute doesn't make sense if you think it like this
you go to jail because you refused to disclose some ios 0days
if you abuses it it's another thing
hoarding bugs and exploits is actually not uncommon
how is that deserved
not very useful bug
useless bug
and relaxes sandbox for no reason
checkra1n being stupid
any way i like
on checkra1n
i know checkra1n relaxed the sandbox
inb4 a h m r repos
just wait
it's not going to be fast with that ram and cpu
also it will boot straight to graphical login screen now
well you still need to downgrade to 14.7.1 for checkra1n
also you are done
there
bottom left hand corner
just say no
you can find programs in the start menu by the way
log in as gavin
enter that command
this is super close
i cant see the entire command you entered
checkra1n with checkra1n_memo
so no need to scroll up
which can't downgrade like this
and iphone 5c
even if it's isn't really related
i can't just put someone's laptop in an unusable state
i mean
and cpu because compressed
so it's more like your hard disk speed
btw when progress bar appears , download is done
used google
i just
so yeah you actually know more than me about the wifi part
connecting to internet is the hardest part because i don't have a laptop
just run those command one by one
stream ded again but no need actually
also there's no stream
that takes long time
and i assume the second one is still running right
this will be better than xp
general vc
no stream
a desktop environment is not small
also press ctrl-x to exit
etc not ect
wait that to finish first
go back to
i realized the problem
wait a moment
one by one
all right do
apt install task-lxde-desktop
run tasksel
run apt-get update again
press enter
enter
enter
actually
then enter twice
press ctrl-x
delete the leading space as well
delete the cdrom: line
it actually connected
also etc
towards to end
append
run that command again but
you didn't connect
ping -c 1 google.com
and  tasksel has menu to install stuff but that needs internet
now connect to wifi
lol good
i disabled scanning explicit content in dm
u0 will never ship subcursus
it triggers that more easily
generally if a image has at lot of white ish red ish and yellow ish colour
send base64'ed image
ok but it isn't accurate
does subcursus still work
1700-preboot iphoneos-arm64 test bootstrap
rick ashley - never gonna give you up (offical music video)
have you figured out preboot iphoneos-arm64
just go to internet archive
everyone knows what a dqw4w9wgxcq is
protoprocursus
checkra1n memo is protoprocursus
where is tang
how about checkra1n memo
youtube reborn is on internet archive so :fr:
idc doesn't i believe
about useless hardware vulns we have on on m1
i mean
is it just a memory corruption crash bug
also unless i am wrong bootrom shares a lot of code with iboot
nothing real
that's just a bug right?
`poweroff` to shut down this thing
wait then
tether the phone
can you tether
do laptop have internet right now
so much stuff is broken on ios 15
sure you can try
so it must have the driver
the netinst worked
because
no way
ok then
can you get ethernet temporarily
use `ifup wlan0`
you didn't select anything under debian desktop environment when you are add select and install software screen
now connect to wifi
which is the admin user
but there's also a root user
this says you are gavin
you should type `logout` and login as root
this means you have set root password
does sudo command exists
i think you need to connect to internet
did you set root password during install
login is just username
you didn't instal a desktop environment
just use firefox
don't even try
installing chromium is killing yourself on 256 mb ram
this is not real
it comes with firefox
firefox, yes
you don't want to
it should still go throgh
i can reproduce it here
that's just a problem with low memory mode
or course it's gonna overwrite everything
well you used the entire disk
want to make sure everything goes right
i just
you used "use entire disk?"
(if you have a printer that is)
you need to go through the entire install
it will
also are you using the cd installer
8 am here
also i was sleeping
all files
just say you have a power failure in the middle of an update
and swap
just look at ram and cpu
attempting to use discord on this thing isn't the best idea
just use checkra1n_memo
no need for procursus in checkra1n
but your pc is 32 bit
the other checkra1n iso image that works on 256 mb ram is 64 bit
unfortunately you have to do full install
also it's dvd
on1x won't work on 256 mb ram
keyboard did work  for previous steps
256 mb ram
wifi detection
and he already get past
the one with all the firmwares
the firmware cd
i tell him to download
and the arrow keys
enter
use a blank root password
for user setup
and stuff does get complicated when there's little ram
ok it should work
this almost certainly has something to do with internet
for user setup
guided - use entire disk
also for partitioning
nothing
deb.debian.org always works
this actually
ill figure out the list
ok wait
continue
the text installer should work
reboot and use the "install" option instead(as opposed to "graphical install")
can you
and it's 32 bit
specs too bad for ubuntu
but that laptop has bad specs so
it shouldn't be too confusing
use the graphical installer
you just
probably
not enough battery
for obvious reasons
and disable auto start
default should be good just make sure it associates with iso
it just needs to copy the image bit by bit
try it
but whatever you need to burn the iso to the cd
that isn't a big image
and usb doesn't work so you need to use discs
well i see that on your desktop
use poweriso to burn that image
not like that
and i see you already have poweriso
you just need another program
in this caae
you can still use cd
and dd mode
and make sure rufus 2.18 really doesn't see it (see the drop down memu)
looks like you need to use the dvd
this is win xp so
you can still use cd
if it ends up not work
can you replug and wait  a few seconds
did you plug it in
because it doesn't count vfs cache and buffers
htop has a more representative ram usage
it's the right one for windows xp
this is last version compatible with windows xp
welp wait
also did rufus open
no need for low memory mode
it should be good
512 mb it is then
untested version
how much ram
it can't be too long tho
bootloop
and plug the usb in
i think
it finished downloading
reboot and rejailbreak
oml cortex a53 chips sucks
discord search exists
because it was
procursus was called checkra1n_memo
that's the meme subreddit
that's jelbrek
jelbrek
how much ram
cuz 32 bits
but actually how much ram because 256 mb ram is just the standard spec of that laptop
so we are doing debian
256 mb ram
threads would be handy but
but that's really compliacted
or uefi shell
use dvd
this website support insecure http
cmos battery ran out i think
set the clock
windows xp don't run with 8 mb
also this means that odysseyn1x will 100% not work
which could be confusing for inexperienced users
the installer will go into low memory mode on this thing
aight uae rufus
but it's about somehow modifing c:\windows\system32\config\sam
and maybe see the password hint
try again
and nuke windows xp
just use rufus on another computer
you need another computer to get past this...
yeah it's an isohybrid image
as long as the laptop can boot from it
it doesn't matter
you want full install?
it does
does it support usb boot
get a cd-r disc
this is ancient so
that doesn't matter
it ran like dogshit
i once set the cpu clock speed to 800 mhz and disabled smp
so you want to use checkra1n on this
just use backports lol
so it should work
that laptop prob i686
that's a 1989 cpu
remember checkra1n is compiled for i486
that's not even a requirement
if you use that on desktop you are cringe
go to debian with firmware i think
~~procursus~~ checkra1n_memo
there is sdk you just don't have it
you have an incorrect assumption here
good luck
but i can't find any version of bridgeos sdk
just don't call it arm32
whatever
which includes armv6
all possible 32 bit iphone cpus
because it's technically more precise
armv7 it is
but uh
base iphoneos 2.0 support - diatrus
or libsystem
because at some point you discover that you have to polyfill xnu
although that won't really  work
that just means making more .mk files
armv6 can go to 700
pretty sure apt supports armv6 arch
ill probe you wrong
it's about this situation:
that doesn't make it invalid
iphone 2g and 3g exists
we should use iphoneos-armv7
and to diff between armv6 and armv7
on iphoneos-arm64 the debs are called iphonos-arm but we still use iphoneos-arm64
um no
and it's mostly for haydenfetch
i have repo
highly misleading although most of time technically not wrong
which has a decent amount of debs
and modify it there
made your own repo
that makes trival repo
!t checkra1n
add back !t real
!t fr
(joke)
buy another device
and i don't have any iphoneos-arm devices
is long gone
my iphone 4
compiling on a5 moment
(not really)
all procursus build dependencies
x's gonna be hard
wen eta
there's nothing preventing to use amd64 deb files in utm se
technically anyways
you can use deb files just not iphoneos-arm.deb files
for jailbreak
but no you need to buy another device
tf is a cydia scripts
uart jb
killall -9 lightmodeuserd
uart based jailbreak
then you have tethered
just messes up the codesign of launchd or something
with checkra1n
technically you can make one yourself
from generation to keyserver upload
people need scripts
make it yourself
apt repo it is
no more "cydia" repo
please
i think
now make a repo
trolled
and some binaries
talking about facts
no such file or directory
deleting a block device doesn't actually do anything
the problem is
launchctl reboot userspace
cydia had a waitlist for the longest time
or it didn't happen
restore rootfs
all right reserved
on there
packix isn't a dist reoo
looks like deleting that isn't exactly the best idea
reimplement that and make it even more extreme
although in reality it's more like sane user mode
and have a developer mode obviously
aka dumb down everything
and have that as default
that hides all of that
just add a baby mode in sileo
and it probably compained mobilesubstrate not found or something
the dependency hell
zebra is literally the issue here i think
zebra user incoming
sftunickchan
pojavlauncher-data should contain architecture independent files
pojavlauncher and pojavlauncher-data should be enough i think?
i mean
what are those file
what are they anyways
do it
that's why we can't have nice things
substitutesettings.app moment
youtube reborn depends youtube-dl which depends ffmpeg which depends on a bunch of stuff
they are depends of depends of depends i think
that's not a good idea
sv.plist but we are not telling you
because it's still up and all
that's really isn't archival
it's for "archival" purposes which the internet archive is allowed to do so
why would people think that yours is clean
and search for youtube reborn
go to "software" section
go to internet archive
it doesn't work like this
youtube reborn is on internet archive
cuz 99.5% people doesn't
then what's youtube ipa
piracy moment
so it's very relevant
apt wants it
you need this to make bootstrap on device
and is not on procursus
that's. on. elu. and. it's . actually relevant
one. fucking. bin.
there's
we just ignore some facts
this isn't lying as well
!t checkra1n
wen eta doregon developer role
nice booster
exploit starts from video
no he meant
a technically-paid app should never be an essential package
be self-contained
also it's supposed to
it doesn't matter
that idea is scrapped
there's rootfs modification detection in ios 15 so
now of course that cause issues
kernbypass-unoffical moment
and modern  app jailbreak doesn't trigger that at all
but only the kernel itself uses it
well there is technically
there's no kernel level jb detection
hardcode them
imazing can edit backups i think
back it up now modify it and restore it
restore a modified backup
so background playback is very much problematic in its current implementation
aight
so let's stop
ok now this is extremely region-specific
hmm but the code is still there on the device
that's piracy
and ad blocking is feature removal as well
because you are nullifing the code that detects background
background playback is **removing** features
by the way
violating tos is not piracy
that's tos
btw, i am not in the us
which doesn't matter in this context
not exactly
how is downloading piracy
and it is actually legal to violate tos in a lot of places
since when is violating tos piracy
youtube-dl still exists
just because premium exists doesn't make making those stuff yourself piracy
it doesn't use youtube premium code in any way
youtube reborn isn't piracy
why would it *not*
aka it works
384 mb maybe
render distnce 2?
overb0ard
can't you make it allocate 450 mb or something
who removed a11moment
mayve
da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 this totally isn't an udid
4e203fcebc38b899f89265cd874e9260a8fdced7 is the worst
4e203fcebc38b899f89265cd874e9260a8fdced7 idk.bin
that has a huge effect on how hot it feels
whats humidity
moderate i think
and it isn't high at all by today's standard
some slow network technology
i can only use hspa netwrok right now
oml hspa is so bad
they did
on pc
reboot rejailbreak
also you need restore rootfs
!t taurine
solution: don't use unc0ver
the only change is the ad and version number
and i probably need dcsd and goldeneye
i don't care so used
how much is atv 4k 1
ping -c 1 mom
$3000 gang here
troll
send pics to me
ez donate $1000 to hayden
and *don't* drag the file into 7zip or something
it's invalid png
because it isn't an image
uh oh!
eta now
and then just copy the sources file around
just fed them as apt arguments
stop trolling
so you need ascii text for each dimension for each image
and you can change that with an option
it reads from a directory
that's not going to do a thing
the depends won't work on elu so
i mean
i do plan on injecting this in haydenfetch
you bootloop
posix 2008 sh
but there's  an if
libpropr1
so do it quick
i know
you need jailbreak to use blobs
you better downgrade *quick*
to match taurine offical
well or mark it as a newer version than 1.0.5 and 1.0.6
we just believe they have it
that didn't prove anything
this isn't major ios version
more like 2 weeks
nothing
that doesn't necessarily mean anything
that's checkra1n irc
eta kids be like
gir ded
buy another phone
watchos ipsw
what kind of lag is that
!t checkra1n
!t checkra1n
you sent too many messages for a whitename
but still
!t eta
no and
trolled
!t bypass
and apple tv 4 is marginal for that
and better cooling
that makes sense on 4k
as well as brokejavlancher
compile java for tvos
and i have no luck
and i don't have an apple watch
and we have to deal with 1400 for watchos
that could work
unless a11-
pretty sure jelbrektime is open sauce
ipwndfu
overcl0ck
jelbrektime
it's not available
technically we should use iphoneos14.5.intermal sdk to compile procursus
not really
nah you use iphoneos5.0.internal
first gen
appletvos-i386
until something goes wrong with a libiosexec update
it's a time bomb
to make all default repo signed
deleted from default
that got oofed previously
you don't add it like this
tvos 12!!
post exact error
i have no idea why glxgears sigsys in dwm
ok, change https to http
which is fine because the device is after a firewall
i just use securitytypes=none
vnc security is still broken for me
nice pfp btw
procursus breaks dropbear so
go to
bigboss probably
you need repos
and various other stuff
in qemu
remember to enable gtk
who use 1 anyways
can we just do gtk 2 and 3
and ffmpeg?
worse than vlc
less than libboost i think
1 mk into 11 packages
cringe
libcdio is
you can test packaging while testing the thing itself
because
i test stuff after packaging
well i have to finish up libcdio feeeback first
just write  a script that generates them from debian
and no control
isn't the depends compiled
i mean
well pr
typing indicators are bad change my mind
xfce4 i mean
whre xfseee deb
it's done i think
unc0ver in filters
!t rootfs
it is supposed
supposed to be in sileo postinst
it is
restart probably but you need rejailbreak
you have to do it correctly
same idea
yes you can totally bootloop
and if you don't do jailbraeking correctly
cuz you didn't do it correctly
use the shortcut
filter moment
use the shortcut
!t odysseyra1n
don't install cydia from loader
aight
that doesn't work
but xnu? not really
and the darwin userland is taken from freebsd
xnu is based of some mach microkernel
eh no
of that again
what's the name
that's not how it works
realistically only one admin has a 5% chance will give that to me for no reason
probably an admin gave it
what trouble
it's 36 hours
and apple pay
and that's use substitute 2.0
technically there's a way around that on stock checkra1n but we don't talk about that
use odysseyra1n
!t checkra1n
the result is you still can't read data
and you have to reboot to perform checkm8 (which wipes ram)
the main reason is data at rest encryption
but not the main reason
that's one reason
checkm8 is... not useful data security wise
nah i broke it using an adblocker
can you see my typing indicator
that's an user id mf
what is a cc
and the sep can detect that
it has something to do with the bootrom reading from the sep trng when booting up
that is purely caused by trng trip which occurs in normal restore
because apple
it partially disables itself
sep is only relevant on checkra1n
get an iphone 4
unless something is wrong with the hardware
you need love.litten.libkitten
ask apple
ntfs 3.1
or apfs v1 and apfs v2 if you wanna divide that
which pretty much means apfs in the context of ios
pretty sure that speed increase only works on apfs
ima try that on fat32
everything in frstickerpack.app
what did they use then
seriously
it's  a time bomb
wait until an libiosexec update messes up literally everything
that's a serious problem
if you upgraded coreutils first then sileo, stuff gets wiped
if you updated sileo first then coreutils, nothing happens
until that coreutils update
that worked for some time
and there was some incorrect assumptions (undefined behaviour) about it in sileo
something very important
the coreutils update wiped sileo.sources
and then add the repos back yourself
update sileo and coreutils **first**
it's gone
then you got hit by the coreutils thing
coreutils moment
im not that someone
in a vc probably
you just need someone better to teach you
it's not
fdisk bad
imagine
just use gdisk
well that's it
you just try more times
it is sorta
although i can send stuff fine
now it just complains about unable to connect
blocking the typing indicator with an adblocker doesn't seem to be a good idea
!t reboot
you missed a space
focus on the error itself
and whether it is piracy is not related in this context
dashmoment
!t delayota
i have rick ashley never gonna give you up webclip
but probably not
do we know it is untethered tho
they didn't release ios 10,11,12,13,14,15 jbs for this exact reason
taurine has no ads to begin with
this is more common than you think -
negative
it is possible to have hw virt on some androids
an exception is hardware virtualization
*mostly* better
jailbreak and you will be different
(or github)
ridiculous
it's  just
it's possible to make apfs linux usb
libactivator2
actually vulnerability
there's a 14.7 exploit
why would i tell you
im -1 now ban me
i have it when i was 13
why would you give a random person on internet your id
not give
you can just
don't type any extra space and you are fine
tang alt
2007 bash
but then it's  still going to be smaller than the checkra1n bash 3.2 binpack
it's not on there yet
run haydenfetch as root
spamming fbinvert to pongoos is not a good idea
lets say
`bash.exe`
the worst deb is a bunch of jpg with a script
it's in another place
msys2
just use
i understand lile 5% of that
mm ok i don't *really* understand this stuff
i only see instructions
that needs some hardware tricks
~~actually its possible if you use that boot selector mem leak that takes 8 years~~
checkra1n has inoot
`inoot`
iboot first stage
how did this stuff ended up on parcility
play systemd
jpg images bundled with a shell script
to mess it up
you basically need to know how to mess it up
dfu loop only appears when you messed up very badly
im talking about wifi firmware
it is, until you tried to use wifi on linux
tldr: unc0ver is worse than taurine
and it is all unified
you can go to firmware setup from windows
and why are we telling using to guess the bios key when
bare metal
required
not really
what entitlement is that
inb4 entitlements
ew why
downgrade to 14.7
boobs
that filename
moderpwner pretty much said it could be used for jailbreak
that doesn't matter
it most definitely can
just check their code
right now
is not the issue
that literally
this is an ipad6,3
i played for 90 minutes straight without crashing
you need overb0ard
pojavlauncher best battery draining package
nfs root
well yeah someone has ubuntu 20.04 running on iphone 7
such as this community
well some functions are not supported
there's darwin specific code
eopnotsupp
also no
not every package is a tweak
this isn't a tweak
read the description
and delete aircrack-ng
well delete procursus first
nevermind
you said you don't have pc
it isn't shit
wine_5.0.3_iphoneos-arm.deb
unless you somehow managed to consistently replace all the packages which is very hard
just edit a particular file ssshhhh
just disable that part
how about one that don't use proc
not really
real people use toybox
that's  a big bruh moment
i386 moment
it's compiled on 32 bit intel
exist
did not
literally
more trolling
checkra1n binpack has bash 3.2
that's a 9 mb checkra1n boot.iso
ignore the x86_64 part
just use iso images
i have alot of random bins that no one else have
good?
i have an ios cd-read bin
a bin that's only on elu
yes 100%
that looks exactly the same
ez just replace some alphabets with cyrllic ones
plz convert haydenfetch deb to dylib
not in tht format anyways
no one tweaks sha512sums like that
he's most definitely not some kid
a8-a11 exist
this is not the context of an app
how would you do it from the webkit context tho
and don't use default checkra1n bootstrap on 14.7
apple configurator 2
proof
why mac
restore a modded itunes backup
youtube reborn
lol no
i have it
just don't remount and you are good
tethered
just patch it out
but a screenshot showed that before
there's seed inside apple inc
give me seed bro
run me as admin
their reputation is based solely on cicuta_virosa
which i assumed would be run in android wsl
that's very legit
apple music exists on android
i mean
aarch64-linux-android
it links to bison  libc
apple made
i think
there's an arm64 lib
we have darwin-amd64
now install procursus
they said that
tech debt
that's in binpack btw
a 2006 bash
bash-3.2
you overestimated them
siguza has shell on ios 15b3
present in ios15b1 , gone in b2
then we can restore the prebootfs
and we can save a snapshot while jailbreaking
it's the best possible location
why would it go dead
also i'm doing xsltproc
we move to irc
make an ios 14 preboot strap to test
preboot strap
*states
how about other countries
recommends got overlooked for like 13 years
recommends wen
and it's telnet apparently
what is ident
we need hping3 on procursus
not dead anymore
the server is dead
procursus still ded
javascript hooking wen?
procursus is down for a solid 30 minutes now
just supervise it by restoring a modified itunes backup
even more fun
i want directory list
just tell people to use one of those
technically there's still 3 working mirrors so
server ded
procursus ded
shshd is good
because this is outright impossible
remove slowmode
this isn't ur server
pongoos screen flicker is sex
well this is what you get after stopping it
lemme send my pongoos screen again
ok i need it in the macos repo then
not `starplayer132` i believe
like the ytreborn drama
well they care about it when there's like 50 of those
do you think users cares about lib*
the sover has nothing to do with the actual version
we can have 1 and then deb version 2.0
abi version
that's going to break ota
restore prebootfs
while jailbreaking
well yes we can save a snapshot
gone.
so it's not going to be self contained
and tweaks will go into that prefix
tweaks is not part of procursus
and they aren't procursus
tweaks are going to go into there
although they are bad
unless
not heap
actual feng shui
and we want a more generic name here
although it's crap
exists
although taurine still has "starting electra"
electra is ios 11
better than default c1
because it's
you can
it will eventually work
try 1000 times
odysseyra1n is just a script
what pc cpu
you nickname is literally rebel
bro don't rebel
dd mode
that's not at all
and hackintosh with broken mouse
no i have linux
incompatible os
get the beta now
and branch off pre-bootstrap
you just don't do it the standard process to completion
it technically isn't a modification
!t checkra1n
iphone 4
me rocking on pangu7
inb4 signing service
well, except when compiling
my ipad6,3 don't feel slow at all
as well
iphone 7
so statistically theres a higher chance the people ask that
because more people are on those
im not using one and im not in taiwan either
mind you
also mainland can't access discord because of gfw
ok about the same then
in spoken
i use some other variant
at least i can't speak mandarin properly
also about mandarin i am bad at that
utm on testflight
testflight
and i only play minecraft
i compiled pongobrix on linux
imagine spamming fbinvert
this happens when i stop it
what did i do
to pongoos device
i cant upload data
until you ran into that amfid issue
imagine using dsa-1024
make an arm64 image
surface pro x
what is a `chinabrick`
utm on testflight lets goooo
this is going to be more important than ever
just escaped from an argument
dpkg go bye
compared to ls -a
ls -a just shows useless extra output
use ls -a
don't use ls -a
what if you are root
unless you mean
tf is a ls
sssshhhh tell me
what is it
im pretty sure the kernel has something
that's when the oom killer kicks in right
there's
yesn't
also isecureos has jetsam crash on my device lol
you need to hook something
hows you a tweak developer
not in the narrow definition anyway
pojavlauncher isn't a tweak
bro my about me is `idk`
buy another device
cannot read property needs_pc of undefined
nothing
buy another device
also demon is a member+
how many cpu cores you have
it isn't...?
the amount of ram it needs is ridiculous
but fr tho, qemu could use that much
well you said was
batteryramp
run it from mac
use the odysseyra1n install script
well , actually 18.2 mb
about
18 mb
it's not a very big file
data transfer rate
it shouldn't take more than 60 seconds
did you click start
idevicebackup2
also it's a panic
more dramatic than ever
that just make a reboot
every reboot is a restore rootfs although that custom rootfs is kept intact
im in their discord
for this one
it technically is
darwin 21 shell
remove it and say yes
6.2.0 is 6.1.2 but with a different version number so pwn cam have a new ad
do it
ngrok exists btw
so it should have ok speeds
using v8 scriptcompiler
well, it's compiled
me using js be like:
just use python3 -m http.server
well i don't use nginx in my mirror
:stfunickchan:
checkra1n android is a hit or miss
yo it's jailbroken again
sorry im not at home
yo jailbreak ipad
no more uptime
it's dead
ok now press f to my 76 days uptime
can't it just be restarted
why does killing mobilesafari make stuff not start
and see if hayden's gonna accept it
ew time to find public key
bruh filter exists
not like i should download anything from them
i will make them signed
cuz ive been eating too much cake lately
it's in fact easier
it must be somehow possible to downgrade that lg
if it is possible to unlock the boobloader
i mean
or whether it is enforced at all
they have something to do with how secure boot is enforced
try to unblow those fuses
is those development fuses
a better place to mess around with
but actually
with the a10 one
in a14
replace the bootrom
that's still going to be obvious
you get a bunch of icons without names
that's for icons not names
it will appear to be there
yeah nvm
all jailbreak stuff will appears to be gone! in jailed state
but nothing like magisk from user perspective
well, there's actually one very significant thing to notice
except maybe that extra 500 mb storage and some badly designed package won't install
the normal users won't feel anything
it's only from a development perspective
because of all the bind mounts
but that's it
for obvious reasons
on another apfs volume on the same apfs container on the same ssd
that's pretty much it
without deleting your custom rootfs
basically you restore rootfs yourself everytime you reboot
it  will
if you have literally nothing
so it should be fine on 16 gb devices
less than 600 mb, probably 500 mb as well
about 8% of a stock rootfs
about how much space it will take
in any aspect
and we can't be worse than bingner
from another non-technical standpoint
that's the only reason
xsltproc is more important than that
every procursus user is forced to save blobs
don't think it works on a7
delta-beta
and you can't write in *some* paths, but nothing too important
it just requires a little bit more storage
but there's a 3rd way
now obviously that's bad
that means device won't boot at all without pc
checkra1n can just patch out the rootfs signature check
tethered
ok, the other way is
but app based jailbreaks are more limited
checkra1n can patch sandbox
i mean
that requires dirty wordarounds
but doing it this way will soon run into sandbox issues
there are other ways
that's one way
something that checkra1n uses
union mount
also there's no unionfs on ios 15
it's just a huge pain
you are right
and im not really sure of what im saying here
and obviously this won't work on springboard
about that
it is possible to have tethered runtime dylib injection into apps jailed by doing some debugger fuckery i think
not touching rootfs
ok, rootless
and someone has made that kind of -less jb on ios 12 and  it's ...sub par
what kind -less will happen you guess?
now rootfs is problem
yeah kppless happened
actually
ios 15 is a big bruh moment for jailbraek
a phone
yes but it doesn't verify that signature of the nor flash
in fact every iphone does
some "organizations" that are obviously schools requires that apparently
have you tested google classroom
what is an os
least restrictions
ez get librem 5
that's everyone else's problem
it just isn't public
and he's technically not wrong
well, it exists
5030 results
`wen eta no xcode?`
not macos
it's just that procursus ios compile is problematic
also thats pretty cursed
i tried to prove that procursus ios can compile procursus ios but failed
well yeah, because make apt is broken on device because of this
but ios
bingner
and i have no idea where to get it on ios
although that's can't happen because signing
apple ipsw dvds wen
troll
yeah getting rid of emacs fixed it
gettext wants emacs for some reason
cringe indeed
why would a build need emacs
now shut up
before 2025
ok i will give you an eta
gettext
bruh stupid discord feature
cpu usage be like
make ncurses-package
this ipad is so hot that it's like it's going to explode
cuz tcg is shit
that's very unpractical
until you get to the nand stack
keep reentering the boot selector
should be somehow possible to do via mitm'ing using a vpn i think
and it is additionally subjected to eula stuff like that
and only **use** the app
well, you paid money to **use** the app
ok why epoch in utc+8
nsfw pfp
dont warn me
boobs
imagine having too many blobs
it doesn't
b!device add never works
sudo apt install openssh
use apt
use apt to install openssh
the laggy terminal
require ios 13.0 or above moment
odysseyra1n installer
with a big enough tweak...
first yes second no
there's no problem on that side
also this dodged all copyright issues
i have a github action that publish modified apps.json
im very uncomfortable about putting alpha stuff in main
and delta-alpha on experimental if that component exists
delta and delta-beta on procursus
ew it's cleared again
and shc
sometime in augest: procursus server broke again
it doesn't
it should be persistent
pls show me screenshot
what is super secret channel
that's long lmao
remount is messed up pretty badly
hows ios 15 app jailbreaks gonna work
mfers be like
good i think
wrong ping
it is auto installed as depend on procursus anyway
someone already did that and was forced to rootfs
which breaks stuff
people's gonna install shshd on u0
this is going to cause mf trying to install shshd on u0
ios 9
pp jailbreak best jb
you need to be a good command line user to discover that
parent directory and stuff
unix path
invite filter
with efistub
uefi shell can boot kernels
think uefi shell should work
checkra1n
i have a 9 mb boot image
in wsl
create your own boot image
this is fine
it's removed in latest commit
sileo.sources
you need to edit
actually, sileo's error message is too unhelpful
it *should* filter that
technically not bypass but bad  filter
jb server is never filtered
thanks
it  instantly sends an end of file
it doesn't let me answer it
how do i answer dpkg prompts in sileo
cydia store
is there an ios binutils
how does it not work
that moment when haydenfetch panicked taurine 1.0.2
jailbreak detection moment
this one should be easier to look at
because there's two people
scripts
you said restart ui
sbreload
imagine reloading the entire cache for an app
sileo has triggers
ew im exposed people can find me in procursusteam
to get haydenfetch to work on mac
that's what i have to do
i think
it's not added into big_sur yet
compile them yourself
clone the procursus repo
demote should be default on checkra1n
just add unc0ver and u0 into filter
ota blobs are real blobs
:bruhinside:
installing winodws to c:\con
how mamy package do you have
untaurine
im not  a nerd
-(bool)isaccounttangalt:(id*)arg1;
why does this get fr'd
blob exists
where can i find headers for frameworks in developerdiskimage.dmg?
:sftunickchan:
irl jailbreaking
!t eta
what devices you you have
get an iphone 7
buy another device
buy another device
that never was the problem
install it in sileo
don't install it from loader
also if you want cydia
just use shortcut
the bootstrap is
because default checkra1n doesn't work properly
buy another device
with a question
make that pic into a tag
also you can't downgrade
buy another device
ipod touch, homepod, ibridge t2, apple watch
ipads
and actually pinging the everyone role doesn't ping anyone
because it is pinging the everyone role
libcdio-utils...
libiso9660-11 on da ios
libcdio on da ios
if sep does work at all
ios wouldn't boot
you can
and i have a sticker that's actually youtube reborn deb but i'm not going to share that
that's a tarball
unlike discord which doesn't validate stickers
on ios 13.0
then you bootloop
setting background to a zip using shortcuts
does that shortcut zip background bootloop still work
it really doesn't have any nekofetch code anymore
it's so modified that
also im only mem pro
i messed up stuff a little bit
i dont
you have dev role
well 73 days
but i know
well i have 71 days uptime too
which allows restore rootfs while bootlooped
theres force revert
bootloop may not be fucked on checkra1n
i need to fix that rickroll a little bit
broken
slash s
jjdiddwksjfkqqldjdojwkwwfkfnf.mp4 mp4dl
compared to some other chips
so even "weaker" is strong
remember apple arm processors are a beast
not weak
weaker
just a weaker one
a smart tv needs processing power
ok, but it does
propr.mp4
so its not going to get a good processor
an apple tv is not supposed to be a mac mini connected to a tv
that blurs mac mini and apple tv
never
and dyld restrictions
that's not going to work because springboard vs pineboard
but yeah
well, more like a team member let me in
that pateron discord
and since it is offical i have access to that discord as well
offical access that is
i have access to altstore beta without paying a cent
i want apple tv
server down
im stupid
cringe
imagine using google translate
!t nopc
nick chan can write chinese exposed
that's a discord ripoff
so not that
also this looks more like taiwan
gotta love it when filter doesn't work on foreign
jailbreaks.app
revoked
that's a samsung chip
a3 doesn't exist
what are blobs = no
odyssey 13.7
donate 0 days to coolstar
when this loads, ios 14.6 jailbreak comes
!t eta
altstore beta is good
heres a decompressed tar
stuff
or whatever
zstd -d bootstrap.tar.zst
decompress it somewhere else
fr on procursus
when the procursus is sus
or special one that can apply a voltage on the force_dfu pin
or old apple ones
yes, some 3rd party one
also you can break rsa
if you find a fast way to factorize a very large number you can crack all apple signing
procursusteam has good stuff
no that's going to take more than a million years
shor algorithm
actually more like 100 years
considering improvements in technology
ew more like 200 years
and tether boot
well yes on a11-
yes and no
you cant
downgrade to ios 14.6
iphone 6
the one in the repos are outdated and orphaned (= no one maintains it)
i need libimobiledevice freebsd builds
this is 100% because of installing cydia in loader in odysseyra1n
which requires rootfs
you need to remove elu
this nickname is fine i think
mr. refifind!
add or remove a random repo then try again
think it is that sileo 2.1 bug
something with libimobiledevice i think
it's possible
also called entangled_nonce on a12+
apnonce is generated one way from generator (+ some device specific id on a12+)
yeah that one
you need to physically threaten them
dra1n drains battery
there's nothing wrong there
kepp following
decompress it on linux
smh use procursus
project zero
that exists for a reason
only parts of it
on macos
also you need procursus to build procursus
best for procursus
macos is the best
it's better anyways
use pc
then make pexec i think
and comment out the line with do_patch
cd procursus
you execute it in your interactive shell
no i mean
and change everything
you just copy one of the existing malefiles
they will remove it for you
show it to apple
that's what it mean
bypassing activation lock
eta isn't allowed
"nick chan" has two words missing  actually
it's full name or nothing
which i do not want to do
ew that's going to expose myself
that emits controls as well
cuz i got an even better generator
pexec
i can rush something like this in 15 minutes
on build system
autotools i think
nothing that you need to take care of
well it depends on firmware but
that's going to be the slowest thing  ever
first of all, no depends
well, it looks easy
we  want alot of that
if you want to port

c10b4dad3efce834034e0bb3dd696c8bc15ea7ba8ad8e58817a426393efb3270  something.bin
that's checkra1n
we do have some borked stickers
launchctl reboot reroot
it's just extremely annoying for the most part
it isn't
that's a preprocessing directive so
totally not c
get checkra1n to work on ios 15
send messgaes read messages embed links read message history
just give it min perms
tsssaver doesn't like homepods
theres a breakout board
jailbreaking homepod
the reason is it has signing service
that's isn't the reason
(not really)
so yourself is not competent
this server is toxic ig
lol no
except it isn't
imagine asking for eta
until i tell people to rm rf var that is
if they have some
does mods take their own warnpoint off lol
aight dictionary time
a10+ does not include a10
a11 is not a11+
corellium doesn't support ios 6 does it
and on a10+ the hardware doesn't  support aarch32 execution mode
and cam is real nice
unlike some accounts
i mean
and there's one person at level 114+
i need member one
that's a hyphen not a dash
just use tigervnc
t real t fr are gone
just put it in safari
launchctl reboot
!t bsod
lol what i ldrestarted and the device thinks that it just finished updating
nvm it does exist
that has something to do with process running in deleted directory i think
that makes 0 sense
not like that
sileo should use su or sudo
bakgrunnur i think
i really need that kind of tweak
backgrounding
found alterations to batterywaster
also `sudo apt update` finally worked for the first time without warnings or errors since 2007 on ios or iphone os
it does
gpg signing
the only criteria here is whether the repo has a working signature
they aren't signed
the only repo that should be stock should only be odyssey and procursus
how to fix frstickerpack crash on launch
as large as your remaining space go
i'm not very sure about that
64 bit
and is there a public ios 7 iboot exploit
or ios 10 with ios 8 modified in
you can take ios 8 as a jailbreak component
the result satisfies all requirements on untethered
and you can do that automatically on boot using coolbooter untethered
and you can dual boot ios 10 using coolbooter
and ios 8.4.1. can be untethered jailbroken
i mean chainload ios 10
first of all , ios 8.4.1 is signed for 5
that's pseudountether
it's possible to untether ios 10 on iphone 5 now
a9 is one of them
theres an ios 11 untether exploit
that looks like it
did you delete bootstrap repo
how many people does that lol
you can use substitute on stock checkra1n but
i mean
enjoy ur respiring loops
unless you are on ios 14.6 stock checkra1n
!t taurine
now the problem is does it even work
put it in a virus scanner
also that's 182 kb
it can be literally anything
and devhelper.c
dont ask me where i get those files
an amazing app
an app
no you use ish
rename the file extension
and run tar -xf on that
this works
it's just a 5.2 kb tarball so
network tab
inspect element
mv file.{tar,png}
and this is a tarball sticker thing
just stich a passphrase to the key
for that matter i have  like 8 phone numbers in 6 different regions
a use case is that you are downloading from a copy of the original repo, and you want to make sure it is an unmodified copy
to make sure that whoever hosting that mirror doesn't modify the debs
also, all default repos are now signed
key becomes particularly important when you have mirrors
yes i think
ah yes, so adding an extra line to your repo update script is too much work
i asked utm dev for key and i got no respond
and bigboss gpg is still broken
miscellaneous
there's discord that make the client unresponsive
this chat is beyond cringe right now
light mode moment
that one is lethal
infinite pings server
everybody agress haydens server is less toxic
that's an actual channel
lester is best admin
because it actually did reduce
!t real
that's what jtv mean i think
find a vulnerability in ios 14.6 and get some kernel rw primitives
freezers are for losers i use ln2
git sdk 64
on windows
you can run odysseyra1n script
and linear decay is worse then exponential decay
not exponential decay
battery decay is linear decay i think
that doesn't have to be a pc, but it usually is
well you need some sort of checkra1n-compatible external device to connect to the usb port of the idevice to be jailbreaked
that doesn't *have* to be a pc but
well you need another device to connect to that device via usb
sileo tv
it does
i really want to see !help mute
there's probably different keys for different devices
steal apple private key
also pls no all caps
that doesn't amount to a ban yet i think
no not quite
an admin is in the chat you better calm down
and i will never find an exploit
if you have this on your device ur bad cd81f1b7eb405f37b4f26ae94b72b29e9a8dcf2420dd05a37e401337dd5a0b80
now wait unill elu start disturbing the keyrings
force secure apt in sileo
that's the no icon abberivation of that server
h'ss is better
just don't use this server
good luck
and yes you can
that's not piracy
good luck because passwordauthentication no
exposed to the internet
my ipad ssh is literally
which is true in my case
it's possible if it is set up correctly
just forward it
yes i have legit did that
allows you to use your iphone in asia in america
uefi is an amazing thing
ew who use old ass pc to jb with checkra1n anyways
vfs: insert root floppy and press enter
insert floopy 5
after boot
ask for more floppy drives
no the only way is to
`checkra1n.efi`
first you have to shrink checkra1n itself first
# config_mmu is not set
go to an apple store and sideload
0.12.4 (?)
dd mode
anyways here's it
it works with dd.exe
well in terms of hardware
that image only 50% works
gl finding that
and it isn't an english name so
which i am not revealing
there's two whole words missing
when it is not
and it *looks like* it is a full name
people recognize nick chan now
bad tweak moment
and bump the version
submit a pr if you doesn't like it
bruh i was about to say that
how about this
nyuszika7h apt keyring
i know a big site that does that
the first letter
because everyone else is capitalized
when someone call this a virus:
reprovision reborn
dynastic isn't default
and bigboss's gonna be a problem
eh we need to get all defaults signed first
make isecureos flag elu
are we using oversided emotes yet
clang -os lockdown_helper.c devhelper.c -lirecovery-1.0 -lusbmuxd -o devhelper
not too hard
nvm got it
does anyone know how to compile checkra1n's devhelper
how to set memory limit in pojavlauncher
jailbrake
try downloading the sticker and use tar to extract it
and as it suggests it is some source code
~~or rename a deb to png~~
rename a tar to png and it can be uploaded
that sticker is not actually an image
wheres packix
real(edited)
this time 100% legit
as sticker
ima upload a tarball real quick
p sure that worked before
filter.exe
where does that come from
upload a tar as a sticker before it's patched
nothing much
that's just for a  dm so
the king sent a friend request to me so
~~no more youtube reborn sticker~~
no more sticker
and yes it's an actual deb but it's deleted now so
else it would be contributor abuse
why did i always get the abbreviation wrong
i better delete that sticker from h'ss brb
very real
any file
actually stickers can be anything
stickers are just oversized emojis change my mind
they just don't knoe
this is actually better than some whitenames
eh, don't call them stupid
boobs
!t yt
yeah that's real
broken stickers be like:
you forgot a space
probably need sudo
delete it in terminal
it must be somehow removable
rm -rf
hey but siri still exists
upside down
you can in some apps i think
and you can access all portions
flip it
yeah nvm
and altstore + side appears on left side
use siri to open settings
and i think you can trust apps from left side
use siri to open if ,altstore appears on right side
!t odyssey
that should be possible
aight
which half
worst case siri can do it
i don't consider install cydia to be the jailbreaking process
that's required for bootstraping
!t checkra1n
checkra1n
that's 180 kb
actually no
too large i think
just rename it to png
i just discovered you can upload a zip as a sticker
they contain 0% minecraft
and this is why those launcher claim they are not piracy and they have a point
whatever
you're still downloading minecraft from mojang
not piracy
that's just eula violation
but you have 3 apps limit
you still get 365 days after it expires
why does all the good tags got removed
add it back
pi 3 that is
in xnu source
i have a simple ramdisk already
how do i boot a bcm2837 kernel?
inb4 token grabber
put it into virus scanner
and  a few more piracy tweaks
imagine
very rule breaking stuff
something made by juilo
aka 1 second after the end of time on an iphone 5
technically there's nword in this image too
!t eta
tell the author to add it back
so you are not a body
slur slur slur slur slur slur
obviously
that doesn't  make up for ban
id say
not quite
still
actually it isn't the correct one but
and use trolldrop
and macs and ipads
turn on airdrop in all the display phones
i use trolldrop in apple store
actually no
coolstar twitters
is just
and the menu section
how about member pro
is there a jelbrek discord
send him a rickroll
- 2 words
ip logger
but no proof so
don't use any imagination and it isn't nsfw
not quite
iso image tool
there's a tiny but not 0 chance that outputs an ios 14.4 jailbreak ipa
you probably want to get an iphone x or older
or find a iboot exploit
!t eta
aight
he doesn't know how to look at a chart
and he stated false
i did
buy another device
but what device
get this instead
!t taurine
turn on wifi sync
that appears on the taskbar
click that diamond thingy
fdr erorr moment
now search for altserver in taskbar search bar
just install taurine with altstore
cydia but better
!t taurine
and make a jailbreak out of it
what device and ios
i mean the cydia question
can you be more descriptive
what scam
bloat
can you try a few times more
and what phone are you trying to jb?
i just need to know amd or intel
what pc cpu
although putting stuff into efi from windows is a pain in an ass
these components can be taken from checkn1x iso
assuming you have vmlinuz and initramfs.xz at root of fs0 which is usually the efi partition
why does people say you need removable media to boot linux when you can just use uefi shell
why keep 8.4.1 signed
side channel communication
that said it does have a useless hw vuln
yes checkra1n
4k 1 better
all right
apple tv 4k 1
because uid = 0
jailbreaking includes rooting
try reset all contents and settings
alt+f4
and your dm gets spammed
nah, all you need to do is to `chmod` some folders and it won't work on stock as well
default description be like:
!t odysseyra1n
wen eta "u0" and "unc0ver" filtered
unc0ver
infinite monkey theorem moment
lmao but yes
gm hayden
!t taurine
unreal!
i mean it uses libapt-pkg6.0 directly so
libapt is gpl
i know
even if ffmpeg does get run not all dylibs gets loaded into memory
hows that hard
this looks like uh face id unit?
unless you are a  bsd stan
yeah checkra1n linux exists now
you should run qemu as root
!repo procursus
procursus 4269 packages when
what happens if you guided access odyssey, wait 7 days and reboot
why would it
not without custom drivers anyways
which windows does not allow you to do
it is possible for it to work, as long as you pass through the entire controller instead of the device
kvm with pcie usb controller pass through moment
whoever removed !t real should go to jail
download the linux, x86_64 one
it only works with elfs
ubuntu doesn't work with a.outs so
what does uname -a says
or your kernel doesn't have elf enabled for some reason
incorrect arch
it works on busybox and toybox but not coreutils
it works on table now
plot twist: that doesn't work
or overwrite disk0 with zeros
by telling people to delete var something like that
we all do trolling here
please
you need a baseband exploit
libcdio-dev
inb4 eta is 8 days
ios, ipados, watchos, tvos bridgeos or audioos
which means that this server is against tos
except... they don't
or a ssh key grabber
i won't say a token grabber is hacking
not really
hacking = doing stuff that you are not supposed to be able to do in software
you hack ur own phone
im just going to say that if you send a token grabber and a user runs that, that's not hacking
and android has sandboxing too
everything is vulnerable to hacking
does it install stuff to the tweak dylib directory
i have tons of lib* stuff
download youtube videos and other sites
i have youtube-dl
and 712 packages
i have  a few tweaks
you can choose to jb but not use tweaks
ios 15 is a omega bruh moment for jailbraek
such as broken nfs
sometimes it isn't as simple as that
hung_task_timeout something like that
and after 120 seconds you should get
kill -9 doesn't work on d state
or d state
or raw mode tty
trap int moment
best idea ever
everyone is developer now
libhooker configurator be like: userspace rebootrequired
i dont use tweaks
for checkra1n boot isos
bootra1n is bloat
thisisunsafe
you cannot visit docs.procurs.us right now because the website uses hsts. network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later.
actually i think it's 2
it's either 2 or 3 i think
signing services :fr:
so it is possible to have it on 600 devices
so 100 iphones, ipads, ipod touches, apple tvs and apple watches
100 devices of each type
there's 10 andys
just because all the fruads are in the middle east doesn't mean everything in middle east is a fraud
not everyone is good at english
!t real
client mod moment
and it should be a kernel exploit exploitable from sandbox
1. buy another device
we need a tag for irl jailbreaking
bigboss
dist repo exists from the beginning
this proves that people must be taken care of like they are a bady
just hop on debian irc and almost everyone there  knows how
to find a random person
that's easy
well you didn't specify which platform to add a dist repo on
and i am forced to edit a file instead of doing that in sileo
there was a mistake in odysseyra1n where they used 1600 on ios 14
you should be able to delete procursus too
you should be able to remove every repo
why only sileo.sources in the first place
also does sileo parse list files?
it should allow all i think
if ipad runs macos; then ipad = mac will be true; fi
to do an app jailbreak the normal way on ios 15 we need untethered ssv bypass
it's just locked and sentinel can enable that
i mean lpm also exists on ipados
you can do anything from there
why ship cydia when you can just ship newterm with jb
iphone os
real and real are typing ...
yes it isn't
also good luck compiling procursus for 1300 lol
they are real
because there's no proof back then
they did not say  it is actual untether
in this context
"fake" might imply that the jb is fake i think "pseudo" is better
well it turns out it is real but sucks to hell
to prove they are real
you need a tiny bit more trick to have fake untethers but in general it's not much more
those are more realistic
how about fake untethers
well i am talking about an exploit, not jailbreak
aslr bypass is hard
theres ios 11 untethered + unsandboxed code execution exploit
which does  not necessarily patch the kernel text
you just need untethered codesign bypass
except... it's not needed!
uh no
(2) doesn't really happen on morden jbs
imagine jailbreaking 2000 times (if you have bad luck)
imagine if there's exploit but they are also 10%
you basically need to chain it to a sandbox escape exploit and a root exploit
no you don't need it
escape + root
and that requires root i think?
cant you use an actual ethernet adapter as well
keep it up like 3 months or so
internet archive
it's just annoying in general
well it in fact isn't but
there's a reason ios 13 is not on iphone 6
vm swap exists
(still hard)
well, i meant ipados 13
something like ios 13 on iphone 6 would be way more realistic
(still basically impossible)
ya forgot watchos
also wheres public key
expected a signature
run android 10 on switch
give myself time to retract the keyboard
712 packages
there's u0 it's just shit
because ios 14
taurine is slightly worse
it has the conditions to but it is not
checkra1n with procursus
that moment when procursus keeps so many debs
such as `password123456`
enter `yourpasscode2facode`
its not news that altstore has problem with apple id auth
there's links in the "downloadurl" fields
...and export the public key!
you answered the question yourself
it's in the official mirrors.txt bro
the faq
lol they updated it
libcdio-dev
and delete it - you have the xp
youtube reborn downloads should continue to work - just update youtube-dl
which is the package name
did that out of instinct because spaces is not allowed in package: field
oml sileo crashed itself during install
actually it is closer to 200 than 100
vlc has ffmpeg plus a bunch of stuff
cuz ffmpeg
when 14.7 is out
wait until shshd ddos apple servers
you can get minecraft demo for free
is there an audio multiplexer tweak
wait this guy is unmuted
bold space
** **
underlined space
__                                __
delete the dylib
\*\*yes i mean this.\*\*
and make all characters show
and don't ask me how are type that without being in a code block
this one
\_ \_
__ __
that works
there's another way of doing that
normal space
space
that might change
all mirrors sync from master repo right now
64 gb model anyways
tv has enough space to install entirety of procursus
roastee
most of the default userspace is one bin
alpine
jtv get roasted
**yes**
we use -os
those depends issue
which doesn't work
they are just loader.app on procursus i think
that isn't broke
static = duplicated libraries
not parallel
so it is sequential download
i don't think we have apt-fast yet
56 kbps
not everyone has good internet bro
waiting
absolute bloat
cuz windows users are dumb
well, 6s plus
i own one
16 gb iphone 6s
and dynamic is bloat there
i used static bins on a 9 mb boot iso
also you waste time updating dependencies
bloat
when you don't have something, you find the repo for it
in what way
that's utm key
can someone find me the public key of 62b4d0ba6ef17c99c513e480bbaea83ec0f91f26
i scrapped utm keyring from internet should i pr that
that's depercated
richard g keyring is on there too
that moment when it just ignored the author field
wheres public key
china gfw adds some delay there
how about china
also east russia
real?
which url?
and oceania
we need one in south america
we have singapore
i think
use the rsync script
cuz ram
probably can do some ancient version
qemu (?)
the search bar on the repo is dumb
apple tv gen 1
they don't know what "trivial apt" is in the first place lol
because this is how the repo is structured
they doesn't like dist repo :(
you ask zenith
and dcsd + goldeneye cable
4k gen 1
donate me an apple tv
not happening
!repo joshtv
aircrack
but schools are oudated
read. the. description.
restore rootfs
- which breaks everything
- which isn't very compatible with u0 or default c1
adding procursus will make the package manager update most stuff
procursus is newer than elu -
you need suites and components
because you added it incorrectly
procumsus
reproducible builds
lol 108 unread messages in irc
just bundle xserver-xorg-core in iso
odysseyn1x is true linux
ssh ramdisk
firmware package is fair
in the context of iphone
usually it's going to be something from working to broken
just detect it programmatically
and gsc depends are dumb because hardware could be changed
it's the user's problem
it doesn't matter
actually
set up your own payment system that checks for that
icloud erase
mobile oblieration
and the name: field is just an unused field
not bundle id
that's package name
and has a zygote process
unlike some linux ripoff os that has everything in background
or after the kernel fell out of the world
kernel can respawn after slained by root
reboot
the phone will panic
kill kernel_task then
checkra1n bug
because there's procursus on mac
packix
:frhd:
!t real needs level 100 role
nathan is a us-based person
it's your intranet
(not really)
this one is ios 13
the piracy stuff is on a subdomain of another piracy repo
that's a dev name
search exists
!t piracy
ok, that could be an actual problem
anyways we aren't helping
this is piracy but this is not the reason
and ios 12 is 1500
ios 13 is 1600
ios 14 is 1700
!t noob
we need !t tablemirrors
it's secure - the files are signed by hayden
the contents file really doesn't matter for most users
the result is a broken icon
i didn't mirror the icon and contents file properly
theres only 3 mirrors - we need more
write a 500 word essay explaining why would m sign repo on the sub

sounds like dyld cache
send that to packix dynastic coolstar and bigboss

my procursus download is done
and usb 1.0
and a display
does it has i486 or an 100% compatible cpu + 64 mb ram
quick mak a repo and have a $99999 package
!t yt
yes but
let's just avoid that question
it isn't too bad
idk english moment
it could
there's a similar namr non-piracy tweak that has load as well i think
eli5: app jailbreaks has ugly workarounds which makes stuff less stable
!t eta
mirror
ew my big procursus download still in progress
firmware_14.3_iphoneos-arm.deb
also firmware
(reverse grep)
grep -v gsc.
been a few hours
my big procursus download is still going on
patch apt
ok, will do
also you need the public key
send that image to packix and dynastic support
!t eta
also package managers configured multiple times
nfrpeek
you can
you can
thats outdated
ok so no persistence
and i'd assume it cannot be triggered on device on boot?
as mobile?
there's a bfu code exec exploit isn't it?
that's just faking the ethernet adapter exists
but it needs ethernet adapter and success rate is like 10%
for 14.5.1 right now
actually there's one
and use as a high-load server
the only realistic use case is you have  an ipad permanently plugged in a cool place
this is risky but doesn't break any of the rules
howd you know
you can
!jumbo fr
you should be on this list
light mode moment
gpg -abs -u key-id -o release.gpg release
secureapt will be in sileo
use gpg
sign your repos
!repo alpha
sign with codesign stuff like that
it's just a certificate file i think
i think the apps can still be signed
i dont use tweaks
dont fr me bro
that works
who fr me
just install substitute
you can use checkra1n and unc0ver interchangeably
no restore fs
inoot for t8010
that's 9
ur method is too complicated
killall -17 amfid
you really think i don't know what that means
also bsod shows amfid, not amfi
then download haydenfetch and nickchan-keyring
and haydenfetch panics devices because of that
or somehow proof of purchase
**buy another device**
we dont need more tangs
buy another iphone 12
i personaly won't call it "raped"
depends on how you interpret it really
zebra alpha
and apt 1.8
only libapt-pkg5.0
u0 doesn't have libapt-pkg6.0
id rather use those
openssh-server apt-utils bash coreutils dpkg libapt-pkg6.0
(odyssey comes out)
that is until there's a contrast
can confirm
and 12
wen eta tang 2.0
and you get newer stuff
you have no issues with 1.0.4 either
just use 1.0.4
taurine 1.0.6 is bad bad
taurine 1.0.4 that is
checkra1n with procursus
that said it is very lightweight
it does not
libiosexec1 says hi
actually most of them are depends of depends
not arm64
that's arm
way harder then jb actually
that isn't even jb
ipad 1g
it still exists now
i have postmarketos
you should download libiosexec1 just to be extra safe
what's your point?
oops wrong server
which caused misfilter like that
but the name is too generic
(not anymore)
nvm that works now
checkra1n usb
im just stating a fact
but still, avoid it
don't worry, this server is very inconsistent with piracy stuff
there is signed right now but we are not mentioning it
bypass.html
i should make a tutorial on how 2 boot checkra1n linux without usb using uefi interactive shell
this time about secureapt
filter
i can see a dashmoment 2.0 happening
14.3 is fine
well that isn't too hard
you craft the plist yourself
you can't just use the default entitlements when dealing with ipa
you need to find the mach-o arm64 executable in the payload folder after unzipping
uh no
uh no
not mach-o
an ipa is a zip
hes trying to sign a zip
which is 100% inside an ipa
you need a mach-o file
then you are doing it wrong
the thing signed with ldid
it needs to be a mach-o file
more hardcoded paths moment
r u serious
there's more
please gnu not unix not unix not unix not unix's privacy guard sign your debian advanced packing tool repositories
restore rootfs
there's something not very practical like they had an accidental increment of the boot selector at the end of the main func so if you exited and reentered so many times and get it back to 1 or something you could get the nand(?) stack to allocate a struct that would offset the next alloc of the iobuffer
it will come in 10 years for sure
not 2 trillion
l1ng certainly knows what a dist repo is
uhh no one responded to bigboss question
what is jxdn
crepper
in 1.x
zebra has bad dependency resolution
don't use zebra
although they will probably be like tf are you soldering stuff to homepod
there's some near me
or i can go to those soldering service stores
soldering without experience sounds
link?
that's called disable sip
where
like what breakout boards
m1 support tsssaver?
fdr moment
where is the fdr compatibility chart
haywire (b137ap) jailbreak does that exist
and i can still use sshd
ps2 mouse
add dist repo
sileo nighly can and have bootlooped people
aauto-generated untested sileo builds
actually
commitly
does it add repos fine
bruh lag
well i mean it's basically a giant ipad so
that might be too rude
that's just itunes file sharing
sudo modprobe fuse
you don't have fuse kernel module loaded
you don't have that installed
it's on app store
use termius bro
you can use scp and sftp to transfer files
fuse for ios wen
on the pi
and you can do stuff as if it is a local filesystem
or uart if that's your thing
you use ssh
from the pi
sshfs sftp
sucks
there's no real way of producing bsod loop artificially lol
while bsod
you just have an automatic dongle
that's still tethered
(while bsod)
one force reboot one launchctl reboot
experiments
it gets corrupted when you  force reboot
low battery shutdown is not force shutdown so
1. buy another device
def yes for 14.6
battery running out is not force shutdown
wait for battery to run out
launchctl reboot then i guess
100% yes
it will run out of battery
it works on some linksys routers so
ok , run checkra1n on router then
amd works after 1000 times
run checkra1n on android
personal computer
macbook still pc
laptop is pc
irl jailbreaking
someone else that is
buy an iphone 4
red star
debian
everything happens on-device
no way
i am quite certain that will happen
but then it would be sauce-available
by then it isn't a problem any more
because they said they will open sauce it when it has windows version
actually it won't
or on metered
wen eta filtered for redistributing checkra1n
bad internet
well it doesn't work anymore so
!t beta
and it was allowed anyways
the substring should be filtered but not when the entire string  is used at once
this one
so not typo
it still filters with space between n and u
it's a generic term
because checkra1n
although all checkra1n images are technically problematic
that's the problem
it is macos
that's not the main problem
it isn't
there's a falsepositive command
checkra1n space usb
what is it
that name is too generic
if it starts with check that it is fine
need to add some special case handling
that filter looks for substrings and ignore special characters
it is
i heard that word is filtered, and i immediately realized it will cause problems
you got tricked
hint: it isn't
now check whether this is your token
mtu3nzi5nta3ndgwotyxmdi1cg.dulyxa.brcd2xraqjactumcgpwy4twvqdg (not real token)
what is y2hly2tyytfuihvzygo= supposed to mean
fun fact: you have to insert words between checkra1n and usb in this discord
allowing two device to communicate
wheres amy and ck
use bash
chat = ded chat
unreal!
:6697 ssl
the last thing you want to do is rant in checkra1n irc
pongoos m1 i think
in comment section
from some demo yt video
channels in checkra1n discord
that's checkra1n discord lol
#pongoos
aka you suck
works fine
and appearently you  said lillie suck
well i looked at mutual server
for me it is libimobiledevice
works for me
that's called sed golb_version
give amy admin
at the end of the day it is marginal factual-wise but very misleading
weather control in 3 months s0n????????
soon is not well defined
70% of the time he uses the `real ?` to dodge the fake problem
if you watch the entire video and aware of the wording then there's technically no false info
fce365 is ok
... which is fair i guess
theres some  fce365 fanboys there
the only thing that it does
technically it turns to check mark from unmarked to marked
i mean boot arg
that's cmdline
what happens when you have -s in checkra1n boot arg
reroot and obliterate moment
launchctl help reboot
launchctl reboot reoot anyone ???
elu is much slower
it's like in reverse
new rootfs
silly-o installer
u0 and c1 anti-moments
uicache moment
eh , that's prob webclip
it's a fact
for a very long time
it is and it was allowed for some reason
especially the last one although that isn't an actual image
!t beta wen eta filter
and it is on the subreddit too
there's like 16 result
a lot of times
ew that shows up in search
that was a 9 mb boot image
that's actually possible btw
any checkra1n boot image larger than 10 mb is cringe
amd dfu still works
the. phone. has. dead. nand.
during that
that's not read at all
well in my case it is a dead nand
it won't be actually bricked
you can enter dfu without having nand so
wouldn't it just dfu loop
you can make semi-tethered jb off a tethered exploit
well that would be semi-untethered bootrom exploit
or *technically* find  a bug in bootrom entering dfu mode before it checks for tristar voltage
and one of them involves filling up the sram by having a big llb and use the problematic malloc function to get code execution
that's a usb stack exploit
basically you are limited to the stuff bootrom do in a regular boot
yep that's what i meant
that happened before
it's  not 100% impossible
to have it exploitable from userspace
and that bootrom exploit must happen in the code where the bootrom reads stuff on device
that would  be chaining a webkit exploit to a kernel exploit to a bootrom exploit
that'd be nice
aka untethered bootrom exploit
fr sticker is nice
and it is mips cpu
not server
at home
ive had 1000 days uptime but not idevice
waiting for 69 days uptime
odysseyra1n is the best setup you can have
i misinterpreted that message
!t odysseyra1n
!t checkra1n
!t nosep
!t checkra1n
!t odysseyra1n
do it
that looks like libimobiledevice related
dont think altinstaller places link in destkop folder
find a source for it and add it to cydia
cydia can't find it
better if in freezer
150 tries
looks like it has changed since last time i joined
he isn't asking for eta
and this is not the correct place anyways
its called !ban
~~who use discord anyways, ask for help on checkra1n irc~~
there's more of that kind of stuff
you can delete it or not delete it
whatever you like
seaech for cydia installer in sileo
don't use checkra1n app
install cydia from sileo
actually taurine is
did you have sileo on homescreen
people still use u0
and it should be of a major ios version
deca5
and again don't use loader.app to get cydia
you can get it back with uicache i think
and you can download cydia in sileo
!t odysseyra1n
do that
dd can fill up storage
you can but not like that
great, you just broke your setup
that's not going to work
did you use the ora1n script and then install cydia from loader
hes on u0 or c1 probably
why reply
internet archive has special treatment
it can
there's just no sepnonce setter
theoretically there's enough exploit out there to use sep blobs
because baseband
this is actually pacman
although you can patch the os to work with your sep
such as booting a linux kernel with an initrd placed on a fat32 partition
and you can do alot on the said shell
uefi interactive shell exists
ill look at it a little bit
blobs != boobs
yes that one
taskmgr.exe has stopped working
it is a sh file
panic
my ipad pro 9.7 has good battery life
chariz messed themselves up i think
long press on modify
someone at procursus messed up the sections
in the search tab
nope, search for it
reinatall procursus-keyring
(not really)
dont you love it when you get a killed 9 in the middle of a  build
but actually it will take more space because it downloads stuff from nhc during postinst
download-size is 142 mb and installed-size is 162 mb
it comes with ffmpeg
and vlc is cancer to compile
just use ffplay for that
bg8192.png
lets not talk about another package on procursus in which i shipped 3 huge png files
that's it
hello, procursus!
14 kb of idk what
i did not
you need procursus to compile procursus on macos and ios
i use procursus to compile procursus
i think
and binutils should go to experimental on my repo, not main
the way to add it is user unfriendly except in sileo nightly
the name is self explanatory
and `hello`
that number will explode when binutils got merged
yes i think
lmao i got aircrack deb
people usually takes them to apple store
i have a kernel post-install trigger to sign stuff
and i use secure boot on my linux install
many bios allow you to import keys
which involves trusting your own public key and sign every image
and there **is** a current way to boot checkn1x without disbaling secure boot
we can have iso that use shim loader which is signed by microsoft
the idea is to unify the guide
because there's like 4 possible keys the other way
this is much easier to follow
nice one
speaking of that how to add_dist_repo using the url scheme?
ssh_rd
iphone 6s ios 9.1 untethered is good
it was something like they had an accidental increment of the boot selector at the end of the main func so if you exited and reentered so many times and get it back to 1 or something you could get the nand(?) stack to allocate a struct that would offset the next alloc of the iobuffer
technically theres a leak on a13 just super unpractical
and watchos
ipad pro 9.7
i bet you're under 123
because linux kerenl supports being loaded as a efi application
ive managed to boot linux via uefi shell when i dont have usb
there's bios with csm enabled by default that means no secure boot
(usually "generic usb device")
3) is technically false
yes , and there's a lot of xorg packages
yes i made about 300 debs
yes but not install
idk how many billions of people that are bad at english: no
literally download and nothing else
you di
not sure
probably webclip
version
userspace code execution that is
unionfs is dead on ios 15b2
probably no then
me trying to use uart be like:
and uefi interactive shell is ass too
uefi shell script
but that's the smallest part
probably need to ship a startup.nsh as well
i believe that would just be the surface-linux kernel with efi stub enabled + an arm64 rootfs
might slap an image together whenever i like
because there's no arm64 images
so that statement is technically partially wrong
yes but not windows
there's no windows version
and that makes springboard thinks itself illegal instruction'd
shorter
killall -4 springboard
as opposed to img4tool
i need a tool for img3 files does that exist
welp cpio is so hard to use
this discord app is unusable l
laggg
stuff unsetting pkg_config_path i think
pkg-config moment
help my discord is lag
`upx --ultra-brute -9 checkra1n # make checkra1n smaller`
its so stripped down that there's like 10 commands
that's fair
checkra1n is like 90% of the userspace so
actually 33 mb
thats a 7.3 mb static linux checkra1n bin
electra was terrible i think
unc0ver 1.0.0
ok that's nonsense
looks like you need help with help
hello
no link
yeah like this
the previous one only works on an actual disc
no this works on usb
it has something  to do with captive wifi
there is but we dont talk about that
that rm rf var guy
16 gb iphone 6s
taurine 1.0.4
aka a8 is fine
applemobilefileintergity
then attempts to spawn a process
killall -stop amfid
checkn1x = bloat
twickd is an invalid apt repo
remove authentication
is removing overlays piracy
the solution is to use windows 6.1.7601
removing overlay not piracy?
it doesn't it gives their own implementation of the features
it doesn't give you yt premium
because it isn't
checkm8-nonce-setter exists
a8 dfu nonce collision
a8 nonce collision moment
and only have the usb
did you use dd mode
that's  a no then
i have some iphone 6s ios 12.4.2 blobs
this is isohybrid
actually use this one
wait i should do isohybird
it has to be an actual disc
the thing that makes the computer knows how to turn off itself
i did not enable smp and acpi to save space
theres a catch it can only use a single core
kernel boots in 0.5 seconds
you need at least 48 mb ram, an intel i486sx cpu and a usb port obviously
its an actual iso now instead of raw disk image
iphone 5c
have fun brute forcing the generator
asm kernel loader is cringe
theres alot of stuff that can go wrong
probably some incorrect assumption in boot.s
codesigning
**webkit**
serious info
you can see it is actually bigger
hopefully this works on more hardware
a few months
!t eta
this is normal
rootfs + kernel compression
actually that image is smaller than the uncompressed checkra1n bin
just proof that i actually have such an image
i can still send it but it probably wont work
because most pc doesn't have 2% of the supported hardware
and writing asm to boot the kernel isn't fun
also the bootloader fits in the mbr
this is why i can shrink it so much
normally drivers takes up space and most of them isn't loaded
(or any machine with a very similar configuration)
drivers moment
of course, it only works on my machine
and yes i did compile a custom kernel
make tinyconfig + initramfs compression moment
checkn1x is bloat, i made a 8 mb image
i am trying to make an absoulely tiny linux image
does checkra1n needs sysfs?
apk but you need pc
unless your manufacturer decided to be good and allow unprivileged usb controller access
it's the same thing as linux-arm64
yes that's just linux-arm64
that's a computer i believe
pc != computer
ok why liveboot
why live boot mint
how old has that to be
commcenter i think
if dpkg went wrong
now people are forced to restore fs
tf why ssh only option removed from u0
no because they don't really like dist repos
bruh how outdated can this be
!t noob
or in those 3 counties where copyright does not exist
unless you are in swiss or something where the law is a little bit different
in most counties yes
and distributing patchers is fine
i386 support in linux is dropped in like kernel 3.8 i think
this is the spec
(...) that did not work
how to fix this on odysseyn1x this kernel requires an i686 cpu, but an i586 cpu was detected
!t eta
bruh what did i type
he thinks that c1 is tethered
that's a  function
- (bool)isdeviceabrick:(id*)arg1;
that's a boot arg
it's not terminal
but only proceed in cli
checkra1n detects it in cli, gui and tui
actually it still doesn't match because of space
what you are thinking
well the number of characters in the spoiler does not match
most stuff are libraries and headers
and headers
actually no
because license
clone procursus github repo and build stuff
there's a particular string that matched 14 times in dyld cache
well, at least the 0x80 part is
you do realize that line is from 2010
who use 1024 anyways
i see autofs is on apple open source
cydia is literally a site-specific browser
you really think sileo is more resource expensive then a site-specific browser?
esp. pidof
toybox has some commands that previously did not exist on ios
this is all you need really
and a sdk
cctools-port ld64 and clang
time to go of of the way and compile it
how to install text-cmds on odysseyra1n?
*another* computer that is
you may not need a *pc* but you certainly need another computer
you need another device, with administrator permission, that the checkra1n binary can run
although those are computers in the board sense
any linux device is fine
do we filter any numbers?
sometimes the names are too generic i think
gl finding an a12 device on ios 12.5.3
where can i find a macosx.internal sdk
x86_64-unknown-haiku that is
port cctools-port to haiku
it doesn't use glibc specific stuff so
semi-easy
fr to android is like
however the ramdisk has to be patched to pull files from disk instead of usb
all right that's technically possible but no one did that
there is
undefined
get taurine from jailbreaks.app i think
that exists
idevicerestore
jbapp is signed
chromebook should be fine
you need the chromebook
developer mode exists
chromeos is already linux
why people don't get it
chromeos is linux
chromeos is linux
what does that do
unc0ver moment
you can jump between snapshots without userspace reboot
available jailbreaks: undefined
that moment when there's like 100+ binutils target
binutils pls
snowboard
and newterm does not like right-aligned characters either
that moment when a   message is messed up due to some right-aligned characters
we can move to dm
you want to know what repo that is?
in fact i will remove them later when they got merged
it is easier to test stuff like this
it is just a testing repo
binutils pls
you can use uicache
we already have to use -oz
the problem is storage
well there's touchbar in main makefile
uh no
chromium exists
in order to get that error he must have working internet
that error is not about internet connect or dns
well libc is on opensource.apple.com i think
not talking to you
and they shouldn't actually
adding dist repo is not straightforward
you can't just put a single url
mixing bootstrap repos is always a bad idea
unless you are only using it
yeah you shouldn't
first of all it is not maintained by hayden
well the compile occurs on my pc not hayden's pc
literal package spam
just no binary in upstream
the patches is already in the upstream makefile
it is just hey it can be done
you want dwm
bro gir is slow
bigger than that 142 mb deb
how big is powershell
strapprojects += powershell
or pwshisms
how about ps1isms
posix sh is better
so i know swift will always be false
because i don't know swift
bro idk swift
uh tigervnc is a package
tabletv is just stressing my hackintosh
there's tigervnc but not tested
i have ppc targets in binutils
nothing's gomna compile if you add the memo_target
ra1nstorm
taurine has no ra1n
just mess up the signature of launchd
although it is easy to make one from checkra1n
there's no tethered jb
it does suck
1.0.4 doesn't have bsod
use taurine 1.0.4
silly-o
not sileo
that is cydia's problem
and if you don't like sileo install cydia from sileo
taurine 1.0.4 should be fine
taurine 1.0.4
that's why you use taurine 1.0.4
odysseyn1x confirmed to not work on surface pro x
and `update-alternatives --all`
except that binutils is also on there for the time being
there's haydenfetch repo
you can't configure alternatives
you can't add it in the ui
i think usually you just need to have it open a browser of some sort
the only problem with apt is you cannot install paid packages unless there's a patch somewhere that enables it
none of them can pass the conffiles test
all those 4 have problems dealing with it
there's packages that don't work in sileo,zebra,cydia or installer, only in apt
this is very much inaccurate
how to answer prompts **in sileo**?
`sudo apt install coreutils=8.32-9`
that's the solution
downgrade coreutils
that not going to help at all
no one said ban (yet)
then your account is insecure and should be removed from this server
and it has dependency problem that causes packages to be held
so it must be a upgrade all
a random person don't upgrade coreutils or darwintools by themselves
looks more like dependency issues
how unfrequent does gir update
buy another device
technically android is not a pc in the traditional sense but that's meh
uh i managed to "website reload due to a problem" loop safari
should i supervise my own device
how to i build classdank-dyld
if you want 100 spf (seconds per frame) you can put citra on utm
all right who said you can't mount dmg on ios
well, nothing preventing that  to work but it will be extrreeemmmmeeeelllly slow and you need swap in vm
that's going to be the slowest thing ever because you are putting an emulator inside an emulator
citra on utm wen?
and it needs qt5 which would take more then a day to compile even if it goes right (which it won't)
well it has macos bins so doesn't sound too infeasible
good luck compiling that
best way to know is test :)
there's some kpf commits i think
there's a branch named ios15
what's missing here
that would not work would it?
all right time to test some stuff
pongoos is going to panic or something i think
using irecovery + ipwndfu of course
just get picaboo
what if i use that iboot64patcher for ios 15 then send a pongoos built from the ios 15 branch on ios 15
no one
like, not at all it won't exploit
ipwndfu doesn't work on a9x
checkra1n with procursus is the best setup
im still on taurine 1.0.4
which device
in the coming weeks
"at the moment, checkra1n only supports installing cydia. support for other package managers is coming soon, and will not require a checkra1n update."
i know that everything that contains a cyrillic a is not filtered
a few words, yes it could be indistinguishable
well that's some hanzi not kanji
it isn't...?
we chilling out there
you still new it because you need the sep, baseband and buildmanifest
you need ios 14.6 ipsw
don't literally copy it bro
but it should be something like this
then press enter
press win+r and type `cmd`
now go to your pc
all right
also what os are you on
to match your blob
set the generator
it's just a package
there's no app
libkernrw0 actually
in fact it is so marginal that checkra1n could have real problems there
for some devices such as surface pro x, this statement is very marginal
is it an iphone 4
iphone 4?
im not talking about that
i know that is legit and good
*very bad
ive seen legit but bad jailbreaks
and there's a kind of jailbreak on ios 10 that is somewhere between semi-untethered and untethered (but it's shit)
that is no resigning is needed
strictly speaking there's one additional requirement for untethered
that blcoks ota
i get it no one wants to be dqw4w9wgxcq'd
mp4dl propr.mp4
ios 15 sucks for jailbreak
(except checkra1n)
with a12, well you will die before it finishes
the rng is messed up on a7 and a8 so specific nonces appear more frequently
good luck doing nonce collision on  a12
*use*
you can use blobs with unjailbroken device on a7 and a8 i think
taurine
when electra was shit
don't use bootra1n
how much storage does  t2 has anyway
there's ios 15 ipsw
it's. a. repo. calm. down.
try kernbypass
it will jailbreak any dfu device connected
well, 0.9.8
i have systemd checkra1n on my pc since the beginning
buy a new device
it is only a client side check appearently
i know it is possible because it is possible on android
is there a tweak that lets you jump to a message of a block person in discord
telosphoreo
idk how tho
you can probably rip data off using itunes backup
then delete the filza installed one
then refresh altstore
install altstore using filza
install filza and install appsync unified then
not really
no apple tv
is there a nitotv url scheme
how is this worth $9.99
you wait
although it will break every single package in existence
but really the cleanest solution is to make a new volume
because bind mounted directory will not be writable
each app gets their own bind mount so you can add your own jailbreak app
it is
and they can be bind mounted
iphone 6s, yes
eh bind mounts exists
you can't remount rootfs without bootlooping but you can use something else as rootfs
...yeah
hardcore mode: ssv enabled
are your seriously reloading the entire cache to just show cydia
it is signed hours ago bro
semi untethered can  be webkit i think
it's better not because it is semi tethered
jailbreaks.app is signed right now
well then you are in luck
buy another device
troll
that safari jb only has webkit exploit
talking about this
dont think so
iphone 7 plus don't need home button to dfu
this is fine
ok, you can jailbreak that
get an iphone 7 plus
ldid -s -k key.p12 -sent.xml bin
m repo
a9x ipad gang here
(youtube-dl supports that)
10^5 i think
re ing the xp algorithm isn't too hard if you get a large enough sample size
ok so you need about 1.7 * 10^5 messages to reach level 85
then sure there's themes
even of you patch out macho platform and use macos chroot
uh you still can't run xcode
how much
or tell me the xp algorithm i can calculate it myself
how many messages is that
what member one
buy another device if you are impatient
don't think you can use blobs unjailbroken since a9
unless it is webkit
in fact not at all
you can run macho arm64 executables you like
!t taurine
!t eta
the answer is when it comes out
note: this is completely ignoring the ssd speed
and if you have good wifi it can go faster than that
because usb2
while lighting is locked at 480 mbps i think
router speed
it depends
the programs would think they are just accessing another folder
sshfs has tight intergation into the filesystem
in sshfs you just access your device filesystem as if it is a folder on your pc
sshfs
how to revert to tornadocursus
why would it not work
and the link on the main page changes 10 times a second
any path works as long as it ends with .mp4
people would think it is bugged but it isn't
it's a string
delete it
but even if it somehow happen it may not mean anything
well unless it triggers some sort of double free
i think
..then
that's the filename of apple private key
unless you get factoryprivate.pem for t8010
here, tethered
!t blobs
iphone 5
12.4.2 is the rarest version a 6s can be on
(and baseband)
and there's no 6s sep in 12.5.4
a few days i think
does chimera works on 6s 12.4.2
a while ago
99% capacity because replacement battery
it's not like i can do anything since ios taking up 40% and system data taking up the other 45%
that. but stuff tends to slowdown after a while
stock apps
at least on a fresh restore
1 second
it's the space
performance is fine
there's like 2.5 gb for your own stuff
iphone 6s 16 gb on ios 15 = disaster
that is added a while ago
i think apple has a remove  icloud lock page
well, owner of apple id
apple has the name of the owner
death certificate would work i think
get a real calculator
1. remount is borked
unless you install it yourself
you did something wrong
like?
what kind of hardware is that
!t itunesicloud
you can type the command after pressing windows + r
probably
which is a good balance i suppose
i have prohibit-password
this is aptitude
if you insist on having an interactive ui
aptitude shouldn't be too hard
you can only use apt
there's no nitotv btw
don't  let it install elu
yes but kill checkra1n loader
u on tvos 14?
haydenfetch invokes neofetch so yes
well libiosexec, haydenfetch, wget,curl,coreutils tested to work
someone else tested it
but x11 compiles
didn't try shshd
invoke the compiler and have someone else test stuff
yes but i don't have an apple tv myself
make a new volume bind mount most stuff and copy the rest
you can't remount the rootfs but no one says you cannot use something else for rootfs
i'm using an a9x device right now and it has ok speed
and there's ios 15 for a8
if you try it a few times it will be a real brick
disable thermal throttling; then run a miner
that works
just copy part of procursus update_repo.sh
you download package list from a repo
you don't "download" a repo
it is that simple but people don't do it
i took some reference here when i created my repo
add gpg command to end of your update script
you just sign release
also i think i got mentioned earlier gotta reply
bigboss is a dist repo that doesn't operate like a dist repo
checkra1n app
..from checkra1n loader
why is procursus still 1.0a1
ecid i think
package manager that doesn't support adding dist repos = bad
that did not exist until veru recently
nvm it didn't exist at that time
at the time you speak
there's 5
which package manager has support for adding dist repos in ui
respiring
ihpone 42 iso 69 jb eta wen?
wel it is dos but not ddos
uhh why does uploading to repo take so long
there's a reson it's called trolldrop
to troll
because it doesn't work
it didn't compile anything
well internal compiler error: segmentation fault
segmentation fault: 11
it's just that gcc isn't good on darwin
right
uh you restore to it
gparted on debian so?
it was addeda  few hours ago i think
ipsw is on procursus
volume signing
sealed system volume
binutils on my trash repo
that's what both gparted and ios support
well technically you can copy entire apfs but
uh bindfs
that should work
go to an apple store and use the mac there to restore your phone
well, icloud backup
but their data will be there
anyways building 1500 binutils rn
that's just an extra build flag i think
qemu-gtk
add cmake-qt-gui
but in webkit context you need pac bypass
kernel exploit will eventually come so that's not a problem
slide to jailbreak
untethered webkit jb best jb
when the buttons are broken
that's checkra1n discord btw
no more like you cannot boot without pc
he is checkra1n developer
the keyword is without
well it will bootloop without pc
sbingner is
well maybe not windows
you can use dmgs on windows macos linux and freebsd
the executables in it still needs to be ios arm64
it's just an image mounter
and there's like 50 different targets
you need a deb for each target
thode are not dependencies but binutils targets
binutils is a monster
break into apple and get me factoryprivate.pem for your device and i will sign if for you
a generic der, rsa utility would work but you somehow need apple private key
although it will happen
i just gets all my information from siguza so
letting the battery completely run out or disconnect the battery
dfu doesn't reset clock
no you have to somehow reset the clock
!t noob
all of them are internally prefixed with 9.9.
over the air update lol
these repos all have proper up-to-date gpg signing
it's normal unless it is from chariz, bingner, nick chan or procursus
so it took a lot of time to guess
it is on f000, like regular altstore but the link is quite different
bad security
well there isnt any random character in the link so
after guessing for entire hour guessed out new altserver beta link
just build a custom pongoos with something other than the default checkra1n image
you can but it will be semi-tethered
and ipad mini 4, which is a8 can also goes to ios 15
vnodebypass has it own problems
rip cydia store support in sileo
also jailbreaking with 74 steps is not exactly the easiest  thing
who remembers iphone dev team
how to fix the issue where ssh sessions frequently hang
how to get udid through ssh
and yes you can have newlines in path
idk then
50% shutdown + fake percentage can do that
sentinel i think
how do i delete disk0
you asked two times
reimplantmenting premium functions isn't piracy either
ad block is not piracy
outdated
cercube ipa is piracy
remount is broken on 15
it had happened before
for a short while
eventually all versions will becomes signed because of bugs
just don't go to 15
not taurine
and upload it as artifacts
nah im just going to fork sileo , modify workfkow and keep  triggering it
it always goes to 403 or 401 unless the reoo is veeerrry badly designed
i use apt command line heavily would that work
of course i can build it :)
i do realize they are geeneated on every commit
the one that hosts sileo nightly
data segmenet overlapped onto executable segmenet
overlapping segmenets
where's anamy's repo
bigboss has some i think
just pass them as arguments to apt
that moment when some crappy tools doesn't like sdc128
looks like some very old jailbraek
you just need more bypasess i think
and no 4k 2 gen
as long as you don't ruin that iboot installation
and if you are careful enough, you can do pwned installations of later ios versions
iboot exploits can work too
use it as a server maybe
they asked for the phone, not ios versions
and there's an untethered exploit on ios 11
ios 9.1
there's one for iphone 6s+
the fact it is armv7
from apple store
i got an ipad on 13.6 when 14.2 and 14.3 is signed
enterprise app
that would not work on latest firmware
and you say you use some crap enterprise apps
you didn't thought of it?
7 day return i think
return it
when you aren't sharing it
pongoos was deliberately preventing jailbreak
that patch just patches out panic()
and i know who that guy is
checkra1n_patch
they mean new major ios i think
how is that a hd fr
it is about rootfs
you can get root on rootless
so that's viable
and remember, rootlessjb has an unjailbreak option
im not
it can just be unmounted and the volume can be deleted
everything would probably be prefixed and an unjailbreak tool can just delete that direcotry
it is 9.30 pm here
and that's why pkg still exists
you can't modify other parts of the system when installing nor run an installer
you can
containing a filesystem with some files, in this context it is probably something.app
dmg is just a disk image
they really are just apple msis
you can say that
or pkg
watchos too
i want the web  browser
get to an apple store
apt list --installed
because he is not jailbroken.. ?
interestingly the latest u0 update does say 'improve compatibility with signing services'
there's like 1 no computer method that isn't piracy
`sudo apt install org.coolstar.sileo=2.0`
u0 cydia uicache takes too long
any mistake will be horrible
im using fdisk hope i don't make any mistakes
you need to expand that parition
screenshot
or use checkn1x iso if it really is the case
uhh the iso isn't very big i think
bruh stop spreading misinformation
the thing is the probability
by that logic iso can too
that's not corrupt
dd mode does  not corrupt usbs
dd mode rocks
dd copy the image bit by bit into usb
chmod
and  choose dd mode
that looks like corrupted odysseyn1x media
eta son
and im not sure whether there's sudo on odysseyn1x
you start as root on odysseyn1x so
checkra1n cli respect sigint i think
um what's the cpu
well it should
it takes 2 seconds
there's a jailbreak developer out there claims that he does not use tweaks
great
and use xorg server
use unix tools
not everyone uses tweaks tho
commander line interface
12.1.1b3 moment
there's no kernel exploit yet
relocate reborn
ipad pro m1 14.3 eta wen
so useless
kvm works
linux ramdisk
!t odysseyn1x
you must use checkra1n
oh no
with checkra1n on linux
that's checkra1n on linux on usb
impossible
that's a scam site
= you went to the wrong website
!t checkra1n
bruh that's a scam
unsupported bootrom
jailbreak does not need remount
checkra1n can probably do tethered ios 15 the old way
= won't boot without pc
tethered is fine but the jailbraek will be tethered
doing jailbraek the normal way on ios 15 requires untethered ssv bypass
and windows is refering to, well the  os
there's a difference
but not for windows
you can say for windows pc
yeah at that point it isn't for or on windows
the key is *on* and *windows* but not *windows pc*
that's not *for* windows
you can't
more like 98% of the time
and  on some devices it is so fast that u0 says 0 seconds
sock port on 12.4 u0 3.5.6 iphone 6s
sock port stuff
iphone 5s ios 9.1 is better
you will just not now
it wil
that why i said new volume
that's not going to work
divise can do that so
we can just use a new volume mounted somewhere to hold all our stuff
if you reboot
you can you will just bootloop
scam moment
because stock checkra1n and u0 has shit strap
it does but you have to install com.ex.subsitute or mobilesubstrate
worked. thanks.
gotta add haydenfetch repo
will sileo recognize it
iigjt mode discord
wen eta paid clt?
so just say packages
paid themes exists
safeshutdown moment
it is called a package
he didn't
yep it is
and there's no persistence
the 7 one is semi-tethered
*technically*
iphone 2g iphone 3g iphone 7
the last solution is go to an apple store and use c1 there
that's not going to work because it does  not mean checkra1n system requirements
ive kingroot working on android 8
unless you have an even older phone
this guy has no pc
root it first
then you can try checkra1n arm64 in termux
do it
and it's not going to work because arm and arm64
which was shuted down
is he talking about cydia store
it shouldn't
in the context of jailbreaking you can assume android = linux pc
then you haven't tried that sketchy  kingroot
tablecursus
table
or *you think you can't*
run c1 on android
because 8+ can use c1
that could act as the pc i think
they won't know you are jailbroken if you bootloop
take it to apple store
jailbreaks.app exists bro
yalu extra_receipe  is worse
the cleanest way is to:
according to siguza seal actually becomes a problem on ios 15 so
apt+dpkg and stuff could still work
it is possible to get a jailbreak up and running without remount
the easiest way is to not to
ios 15 kills remount
not talking to you
that's elu source code
it doesn't matter who made it
i can run that because it would just exec format error
downgrade
ios 15 killed remounts
bro don't
it should still pop up
actually dyld_fallback_library_path is better
something like this for compat
for procursus that is
just set a memo_prefix when compiling
in addition dyld_library_path is needed because dyld itself is not affected by that hypothetical library
the dyld insert libraries method is rootless too, it just makes process thinks it isn't
and then unsetting that variable is going to have some... interesting effects
which is more prone to failure
but at the point you are tweaking *everything*
got that idea from termux-chroot
patch all file operations
dyld insert libraries
this is not a new idea
remount go bye
img is
dmg is not raw
which won't work
what you are doing is essential the same as trying to remount a cd rom
you can't
read-only filesystem
wait a moment
i guess
esc :wq
how to exit vim
and xorg-server
there's python and perl on 1700 repo
read the error
you don't use an app to bypass another app
empty list is terrible
try empty_list
u0 has excellent exploit reliability
that's the problem
how to define better and worse
`dyld_insert_libraries=eperm_fix.dylib make` i remember doing that
i think i have tweaked make before libiosexec is a thing
and you are not supposed to dyld_insert_libraries it anyways
that's just ridiculous
this definition makes fakeroot a tweak
oops wrong reply
i have in 2 hours  notifications
if one does not know this they are not a good jailbreak user
you can say it tweaks chown
well, the only violation would be extrainst_ but that's not a big problem
an ios deb that is
well i have a single monolithic deb of 142 mb
and that's given i have a lot of stuff installed on my ipad
nekofetch depends is like 107 mb
but people doesn't really care about size
although it is bigger
the number is lower
they are lazy loaded
like,not all libraries don't actually get loaded  even when ffmpeg is running
tell them to install libboost-all-dev
i like open source
checkra1n supposely support 486 but no one verifies it
preferably 486sx
thread_state.h is in 1800 sdk
youtube reborn depends youtube-dl recommends ffmpeg which pulls in more libs
that's public beta
that moment when  people call random libs virus
substitute and substrate has a near-identical api i think
it should
!t beta
it's in some old ios version
is there a tweak to get back the battery wallpaper on the lockscreen when charging
it's not like it's intentionally broken
what's the problem with not supporting substrate lol
but macos doesn't have firmware debs
on macos because stuff would depend on it
well i actually did that
it is too simple
firmware debs are not copyrightable
there a signature
where is the public key of the utm repo
dpkg packages
there's also p2w
like some minecraft server
actually hacked games are meaningful when everyone is using it
lol filter
alpine apk
was 55 days
utm moment
eh not everything because of conflicts
i should make a package that pulls 1000 packages from procursus
and there's depends of depends so that's  not all
this is libboost-all-dev
they need to see libboost lol
lock and unlock
!t noob
cascer is just a superset of rot13
encode base64 + cascer +  decode base64
and signature is not copyrightable i think
hey they dmcded sepi too
but this thing itself is pirated
it installs a beta os
beta profiles and installers
it is
but it's there
outright piracy
and beta dmg is just
how is !t beta not piracy
!t beta
that moment when configure takes longer than actual compilation
download link pls
i wasn't taking to you
i think im not talking to you
wait 5 minutes
gettext is taking forever to compile
who reacted with downvote
all right
that's called test mode
alpine moment
the core of an os
a kernel
because it uses glibc it should behave similar to linux for high level stuff
gnu mach but yes that one
gnu's kernel is shit
$(uname) at least
dragonflybsd
there are some *minor* differences
and yes procursus support building on fbsd
or comes with the os in case of fbsd
and you can just use clang that comes from linux repo
nodejs golang
that's not required
and we have cctools-port
m1 macs with ipados looks more realistic to me
that's on a9x
there's a ticket for restore and a generator
who knows
ive dumbed onboard 13.6 that comes from factory
that should be same as ipsw restore then
just not ota onboard boards
a12 can use onboard boards i think
save it anyways first
that said i except more stuff to be broken
usually
warnings doesn't matter
there's no other way right?
lol time to see
which takes times to fix
and there must be a lot of problems in the process
by the time stuff are done it's the time
another reason is compiling stuff takes a loooong time
there's no harm getting it going eariler
get it right asap
macos
compiling procursus for 1800 rn
most powerbanks uses a single cell instead of battery
powerbanks are usually cells i think
iphone 7
cicuta_virosa owner has stuff but it might not be released
u0 does that i think
can't you just do jailbreak without  bypassing pac
since when is a pac bypass needed
which doesn't exist for 14.5
there's a webkit exploit, but then you need a kernel exploit
it works on c1 ios 14
does it freezes at splash screen for some time first
changerootfs isn't running i think
the heavy mode basically makes the phone thinks it is overheated and it has 1% battery
yeah that makes sense
and why
as a recommended package because you can't have circular depends
choicyloader should pull in choicy i think
it provides a more detailed error
try that in apt
the error in sileo isn't detail enough so
install org.coolstar.libhooker that provides mobilesubstrate
which repo
what package manager is that
where is u0 tv 6.1.2
usb-c is normal btw
this is like more than 3 times the size of the second one
i think there's one with 142 mb
guess: biggest package on procursus
probably
buy another phone
you should get in a bash loop and wait
!t a11moment
basically kills checkra1n cli every 150 seconds
when i wake up it worked
that said chimera needs freezer
so try 500 times
that's post-exploit error so
that's iphone 5s right?
alpine
well the process of getting that jar download link from offical server is quite obscure so that's debatable i think
and "download a program from it's offical server and run it" is definitely not  piracy
the jars are technically downloadable from mojang for everyone
it downloads minecraft from **mojang**  **without** authentication spoofing
pojavlauncher offline login isn't piracy
`apt list`: all packages known to apt
decrease your font size bro
and i'm only 55% through the compile judging from the line number in makefile
(the latest error is about dyld shared cache)
like sse, avx on x86
dd mode
estimated time of arrival
yes that exists for windows
the flashing program that has no gui is dd.exe
both has gui
i should make a xorg iso i guess
oops wrong server
best one is `apt`
not really, it mess up depends
sbreload
i feel like this ipad is going to explode
it is just a result of many small packages
help some characters does not render correctly and there are rectangles
as you can see there are some squares
this font doesn't work for me where can i get a better font
in the context of jailbreaking that is
collection of basic packages of a jailbreak
looking good
checkra1n with procursus
you don't install a bootstrap
the most stable setup is unbootstraped checkra1n
i have 376
until you run enable
it persists
that doesn't crash ios
sudo killall -11 launchd
that's fork bomb
like absolutely nothing will happen because the path is wrong
it's fine this will fail
kill youtube and yeah
library
autocarrot keep fucking up my messages so
it is ffmpeg deps
that directory has no `release` or `packages` and you are specifying the suite name so
it is a default repo
i'm 100% sure they have python3
python3
find a repo that has it
install python3
it is 5pm here
get some sleep
a thing don't just magically becomes piracy when someone else did something
and ffmpeg
install youtube-dl
if it hook isnoadspurchased something like that then it is piracy
how it implements the ad-blocking
that depends on the implementation
they come from switchboard dumps
cercube ipa is most definitely piracy
it does not steal youtube's impl of that
ok, but youtube reborn did that itself
nothing
it is piracy and a tweak
basically alternate url for bingner repo
airtag i think
well this is the source-available repository
p sure there is one
where is elu gitlab
twickd is not a strictly valid repo
not like that
showing activation lock screen is not bannable
time to delete twickd because it is invalid accroding to apt!
since you have cydia
just delete it
we can recognize the layout
just delete it
the most unstable deb is ci debs
nightly is the second-least stable one
all the faster-than-nightly debs is there so
sileo's license allows redistribution i think
aight
ipad 2 is ancient
lol no
checkra1n rejailbreak isn't hard
agreed
network tab
inspect element will tell you
that's a cpu bug but not rom
that's not rom
disable
there is
sideloading bugs
13.3.1 is terrible
that is, totally useless for jailbreak
allows for unexpected communication
yes a hardware exploit
why tf is there a dyld_shared_cache_arm64e on intel macos
how to ruin taurine jailbreak:
no32exec=0 boot-arg exists
since when is this a pc
all right i should see what that dylib contains again
i know
it does not do that lol
that is, you need to know the exact name to do anything with it
also everything else in the checkra1n ramdisk does not show up in lists, but otherwise they are normal files
how can i make files in the checkra1n ramdisk show in file listing?
im just `grep`ping for slurs
unlocked?
im fed up with desktop vlc compile for ios rn
apples gonna revoke it
you can get that with free account
so i can play stuff in xorg-server
compiling for procursus
desktop vlc is ass to compile for ios
for procursus
if anyone can help me compiling vlc...
on x86
looks like broken tweaks
not 'hard'
that's just annoying and repetitive then
metasploit
msf isn't too hard
how long is this going to take
you lost it
it's just a crap attempt to have procursus on tv
appletvos-arm64
my repo sucks
the kernel doesn't really matter tbh
if the differences are big, then it is hard
generally speaking the libc is the biggest problem
sentinel
your phone can lasts for days with that
ssh_strap=1
how long does a strap takes to build smh
!t checkra1n
doesn't really matter if it is iphone x
1. buy an iphone on 14.3
openpam does that on appletv
some syntax error
that doesn't work
also get the hacks onto a branch of my fork
while im at it i should make 1600 and 1700 straps
that's a no go then
if there's even a sileo.mk
thanks for reminding, gonna try that now
...yeah
no end user will wanna use because
patching the ora1n script isn't too hard
then you can connect to internet
all right just disconnect apple tv from internet
isn't too hard to fix but biggest problem is you have to compile everything if you want additional bootstrap packages
don't open loader after running c1
don't use bingner
well i mean i kinda built a 1500 strap and posted in hayden's server
gettext is slow and everything needs it
im just going to get the ecid first
no information about checkra1n homepod
!t blobs
how to save audioos blobs?
vlc configure is hell
that moment when fonts are broken
i think there's a package that's like 142 mb
package itself
dep doesn't count
which one
biggest package on procursus
just why
!t fr
that is like 512 mb+
supertuxcart-data eta wen
you just spoof requests
man in the middle attack
or itunes it might be possible
mitm?
ping will always work
tf still workd here
i mean da redirect
it's not
so ded forever
minecursus
bsd moment
`su root -c`
no one bothered to work on it
i have 611 packages
screensaver
im going to look into it myself
yes msvc
and yes windows for aarch64 exists
how to compile altserver for aarch64-windows-msvc
libvlc wen
nevermind nvm just right click on unallocated and `new simple volume`
not on that part
scroll down
right click on them
sure delete all of them and make one big partition
then create one big partition
delete all of them
bash is slower
that said you *can* use bash
posix scripts doesn't need bash
i know what im doing
dash likes those scripts
im doing it correctly
they are all posix compliant
imagine assuming bashism
!t fr
im using clang-7 am i bad
well, not-recommended-stuff anyways
it will always drain more unless you to sketchy stuff
that said "yes" doesn't mean it is significant
the phone will be slightly less stable
it is more like partialsep
the phone would not boot if sep is completely unusable so
anyways this is cursed
what are blobs = no
probably not
if apt gets annoyed at it then it is twickd's problem
im just annoyed because that has to be done after every apt update
(yes ik how to fix   that)
midnight commander  (mc) and x file explorer (xfe) is the only onss that i know of
it didn't end up well
in command line
all right i think i did that before by editing some file
im having outdated info appearently
yes they can but they don't know the generators
lol a12 can't save blobs non-jailbroken
and that is linux only
darling exists but compatibility is crap
i'd call fakeroot a tweak
like would you call bash a tweak
imo if something doesn't hook, then it isn't a tweak
in the mean time i should get libbluray into shape
stuff doesn't have ios 12 is 32 bit
well that's a hack but you can do that
which deletes u0, right
you mean s0
reaction
xonsh
fr chain wen
but it is always better to save those first
you need both
a11 pwndfu is borked atm i think
just copy-paste the text line by line into a terminal
you just follow the debian instruction
checkra1n cli arm64 doesn't work very well with samsung
then you have to use a linux device
buy an iphone 4
the only thing that doesn't  go away is activation lock
and tf is why openjdk 16 so much larger than openjdk 17
!t safemode
go to homepage
apt is not malware
!t dfu
how did you know the sound and power buttons work
no i mean type a or type c
what cable are you using
!t dfu
dfu mode
or finder or idevicerestore
itunes
to be fair most packages aren't apps
...frontend
try to search for that online an install it
cydia can't find that depends
also lmao someone got filtered
just use youtube-dl if you want to download music from spotify lol
you should say you don't know
an apt frontend
there isn't a 'the' jailbroken app store
unless you are on legacy
also make sure use dd mode when asked
all you need is a posix-ish userspace which exists for windows
actually i think it is possible to run odysseyra1n on windows itself
but not  checkra1n
you can run odysseyra1n in vm on windows if you really want
and it is possible that you try 1000 times and not work
well, it might or might not work
amd says hi
newterm 3 doesn't crash from that tho
the fact that that commabd crashes it means that it absolutely sucks
i spent 20 minutes in newterm 3 so
then you should care because those restrictions are stupid
if you don't spend at least 5% of time in terminal you don't need to care about that
crap caused kppless jailbreaks not bypassing enough stuff
or filesystem sandbox blocked x stuff like that
it is until you run into operation not permitted or killed: 9
that is in ffmpeg package btw
tried to ffplay two at once didn't end up well
like reprovision made a mistake and because you have appsync it 'signed' anyways but then when you reboot the app crashes
sometimes
you can sideload unlimited apps on 13.3 so
that moment when parcility consider  the maintainer as the author which is almost completely wrong on procursus
the section is borked i think
that guy owns shitc0ver btw
in fact if you patch kernel on disk you are going to rec0very l00p
it says kernel and says nothing
i mean they have an ota switch so
they did not ask for when the jailbraek will come out tho
8==========djailbreak
you usually download it to a device then rip the ipa off i think
there is
...but you can't say something is a jailbreak just because it has that icon so
it is a jailbreak
well, it does have the original icon so people will figure it out
but with the pp icon
it pretended to be some other app
pp something or i believe
it might be possible with c1 actually
modifing systemversion.plist is not agood idea btw
don't you (not) love this when this happens
!t odysseyra1n
you don't
that's just odysseyra1n without odyssey repository
tablera1n
yes it is just a pem file
the phone is already jailbroken
!t odysseyra1n
yes checkra1n is down
i mean all it does is printf("fuck") so
what did you do to that image
stuff like this on da procursus
slow bot
checkr1n cli mode
now i am getting an infinite loop between checking if device is ready to exploiting
p sure thats a no
how about haywire
u can jb ibridge
jelbrektime
ok it's gone
and now checkra1n is in unkillable d state
this is *14.3*
then it goes to corrupted kerninfo
we don't need nitotv
(i have a terminal open when that happened)
everything sigkills
even stock apps
everything crashes
amfid got fucked or something
need reboot
aka can't spawn anything new
taurine
i mean everything apps, everything
ios suddenly decided to shit itself and decided everything is killed: 9
!t chimera
just get checkn1x iso and extract da bin from initramfs.xz
put vm on hdd like a normal person bro
how tf is your main disk completely full
parcility is so slow
please don't stalk me
call him
bruh so slow
like you can't just make a kext that makes task_for_pid(0) works and load it
can you self sign kext i don't think so
it is called permissve security
disable 3 days ringing
im just going to delete that file but it will come back when i run apt update
orange tweaks hooks critical stuff
it is not merged yet
over a year of procursus development has lead us to this
just. use. tasksel. like a normal person
100 weeks = weeks
nightly is more unstable
so fake
that's why i said that
veeery bad
to all those saying 'exploit is unreliable' you haven't experienced empty_list
2 minutes
that's quite some stuff
yo 142 mb deb
there's nothing
if windows you can use any other kind of media
where is kernelcache located on the filesystem
i assume you are on 14.5
no you can't jailbreak
so what version
which could be a pc, router, smart fridge or android phone
well, another linux device or macos
the bug is hardcoded into the hardware
checkra1n is semi-tethered
light theme newterm cursed
and 99% of that package is just .jpg
get haydenfetch
nekofetch takes 10 seconds to install
haydenfetch
and newterm doesn't really like wide characters
still lags but better
there's a link in hayden's server
anyway time to try some configure scripts
which just output a bunch of `y`s
or is it actually decent
let's see if configure scripts lags this thing out
bruh discord borked attachments
also i got newterm 3
does screendump works on ios 14?
also a11 pwndfu is borked
just use checkm8-nonce-setter to set nonce
unless you are on a8 or below
!t fr
wm: dwm
newterm can't handle this
lag be like:
!t fr
does cip even exist
damn this ios xorg madness is real
i agree dwm is wack to compile
tiling wm on da ipad
kde-full_111_iphoneos-arm.deb
that just looks like mixture of fluxbox and something else
then what wm is that
install everything that it says isn't installable then
!t unc0vermoment
refresh your repositories
you use procursus?
get that image from haydenfetch
probably?
crkatri uses it
that moment hayden breaks `make bash` on linux im like
you need tigervnc
already done
or just use fluxbox
if you install debian and choose lxde it is somewhat lightweight
it could be made to be lightweight
debian is ok
well tinycore is even more ridiclous
alpine linux is lightweight
because you need baseband exploit to set bbnonce
tss saver also saves baseband blobs although those are useless rn
tss saver already does it
it allows you to set sepnonce
well that's theoretical only
aka impossible surveys
it does
i have freebsd
the kernel is based on mach with some userspace components from bsd i think
more consistent across devices
as for the os environment you can just use twrp
c1 on android is poorly tested
that said c1 doesn't like the usb controller on some androids
android is linux distribution
that's nothing special
i think there are stuff on app store that use localhost vpn to block ads
when will apple give up on ios 12
how can i bypass no passcode detection?
it is
gives you ios 69 jailbreak
no im not serious
no passcode detection bypass when
use another phone
and ios 14
yes you can
`su mobile`
it does
buy a new phone
or per apple's term, "this device isn't eligible for this build"
because apple stopped sigining it
can't
but you can't downgrade
14.6 b1 actually
they can't do anything about it if we just use the main cpu
no it isn't
but apple can break post-exploitation
because checkm8 can only be exploited through the usb stack while the device is in dfu mode
older versions of taurine kp the device when you try to execute a directory
the freebsd patchset for procursus should get merged soon
it doesn't, btw
for some reason people thinks that asking for eta will make it faster
it's annoying
technically that isn't eta but i get it
it's just missing stdbool.h and stdarg.h
also, the entire system would think that passcode is on
well actually something is better than nothing
because it is insecure
both of it is possible
got it working
bruh why
wifi ipad
i mean unless it is an 5s
well not onto a persistent filesystem anyways
the checkra1n app is never actually installed to your device
otherwise why would launchctl.mk needs you to have your own launchctl bin
where the hell does an arm64 launchctl come from
at the very least the changes to substitute is not open  sourced
u0 *is* piracy
that is worse
zebra says hi
but then you can just run c1 on the linux host
don't think he has a siur3 user on his device
how long ios 14.2 is signed
how would you know it is a few hours
!t noeta4u
i go for semi-tethered whenever i can because i don't want random onp
and it causes them to be inherently less stable
*all* recent semi-untethered have dirty workarounds from a technical perspective
i never said it was as convenient lol
checkra1n on android
that moment when you have to try 50 times for empty_list to work
now that's what i call hard
empty_list says hi
it isn't harder just less convenient
usb c is too thicc
you need a breakout board i think
it doesn't work anymore
since when is that cij 14.0.0.0.0.0.0.1 iphone  7 thing patched
gir is typing
that moment when bash doesn't compile in procursus on freebsd
don't understand
except rule 5
what can  a jailbroken ibridge do
those spotify tweaks are piracy because they hook premium
it is still seperated in some way i mean
although with apfs volumes capacity in system volume doesn't matter now
uh that was the way since ios 1.1.3 up to now?
no youtube reborn doesn't
procursus on da freebsd
it used to work
they fixed that
it won't update
at most 20 minutes
just make a backup
no it won't
make a backup, reset all contents and settings, and try again
bypass.html
cat clipboard
ipad slide over view be like: paste occured
.bludood.com
untaurine
does it have arrows keys and stuff
newterm lagging very badly
amd64
not at all
all right
i have the exact opposite too
hmmmm
it is when not if
uh that is pre-installed
0.12.3 does
also the so-called linux (beta) is a container, not vm
chromeos is linux
it is supposed to be relaxing and the song itself is in fact relaxing
this might cause anxiety
cooler than intel
a12 is cool
im not quite fine
checkra1n irc is better than this chat
m1 is bad for c1
checkra1n team do not renew it anymore
it used to exist
you said checkra**1**n.com is scam
and was one of the official domains
autocarrot
^ this one
!t taurine
there is
that's a11
yes but the checkra1n binary itself is not modified
with some special options
technically it is the same checkra1n
but you can specify latest pongoos
in rufus use dd mode
dd mode
lmfao that site
bro my ipad is not messed up
i mean how to use that calculator
xcalc
where is the divide button?
iphone 3gs bootrom exploit
or ancient videos
!t chart
yes android-x86
you can using utm
especially a8(x) a9(x)
this works
who downvote
i should post on sub
i made a checkn1x iso with 14.5 pongoos
take it to apple
it's done
not hard
grab the build from ci
u feed latest pongoos into checkra1n with -k option
there's technically is
default checkra1n has good patches but the bootstrap is not good
checkra1n with odysseyra1n
the only thing that kinda works with 14.5 is checkra1n and you have to feed the latest pongoos into it; also only a8(x)a9(x)
but the chance of that happening is tiny
i won't say no risk
also dolphinios
i mean that requires checkra1n
well it has odysseyra1n too but
odysseyn1x
!t odysseyn1x
boot linux without installing
seems fine to me
pongoos has ci
no need for building
does it not count
performance will be bad u better set up remote desktop
cuz ur running gui without hardware acceleration
x fordwaring, vlc player
that moment when ssh uses 50% cpu:
actually you can if it is a8(x) or a9(x)
garaged text
i did that cuz ik it won't work
there's some x fowarding going on
what mit shm
but checkra1n,google-chrome,dolphin,vlc all does
i mean xeyes and xclock doesn't crash it
x forwarding inside vnc
actually i use lightgray
ask nathan
use what
thanks it worked
then what file to spawn a xterm
delete those files
`ln` should fix it
thanks
well it was
where
i need vnc server
it's apple inc soo
send messages
8:56 pm here
$99 dev account
either one
buy a new phone on 14.3
a10 14.5 doesn't work even with latest pongoos
lol my name
you only use stuff from checkra1n team
for a8x a9x
actual yes
mess up iboot
if u cant get into recovery you screwed up bad
you can do a update restore that keeps data
restore iphone 4 ios 7.1.2
the same
restore or update
it is not void in the first place
wallpaper
u said bootloop
launchd_missing_exec_no_panic=1
bro don't beg
google is your friend
ive never used linux wifi lmao
im a linux user
respiring loop
stock bugs
this is possible since feb 9
so fake
someone should mark 14.5 on a8 and a9 as jailbreakable
isecureos
repository that distribute software unauthorized
a10,a11 needs other fixes so still won't work
that option overrides pongo image
a10,a11 still not work
works on a8,a9 ios 14.5
get latest builds of pongoos from here
you can
which device?
a8-a9 on ios 14.5 is currently jailbreakable
install  firmware_13.5_iphoneos-arm.deb
install a correct version of firmware_*_iphoneos-arm.deb
about enterprise certificate verification when downloading
jailbreak doesn't change anything
procursus is down
appearently that's altstore discord id
when iphone dies, yes
see: sandcastle
driver issues
you can
also linux and android exists on iphone 7 (plus) and ipod touch 7
pongoos is custom firmware
yes and no
`bputil -n` on da ipad
you can copy but it won't work
well at least it won't work
you probably can't
what can you do with it is something else
you totally can copy it
you open checkra1n app, click on restore system
with a non-default bootstrap
then i did not jailbreak until ios 12.1.1 with u0
pangu7
iphone 4
and no it isn't very big
great, i have a mirror of every iphoneos-arm procursus packages
well technically anyways
procursus isn't affinated with taurine
and yes that is down
apt.procurs.com doesn't exist
freebsd go brrrrr
like debian you can find that on their isos
some os installers has setup.exe
not really
no it is just broken drivers
i have a triple boot setup
also wubi exists
ive run checkra1n off debian installer ramdisk once
anyways altstore doesn't like appsync unified
no that's not because of taurine
appsync + invalid provisioning profile moment
because  it is encrypted
even with checkm8 they can't do too much
and it will be in bfu state
well you got 3 seconds to cancel
and that also calls emergency so please don't do it
there's isn't really anything they can do in bfu state
to you
because android is aarch64 linux
but loader.app yes
the jailbreak itself doesn't
which doesn't exist for darwin since like 2012 (?)
you need qemu-user
acorn
there's also untethered exploit on ios 11
you can
i think a lot of us here could get arreseted just because they have launchctl
realistically no one cares if you pirate launchctl bins lmao
all they could do is beg you to stop it
because piracy doesn't exist in the laws
if you are in eritrea, turkmenistan and san marino, they literally can't do anything to stop you from pirating
u mean unauthroized?
also i think there are 3 countries that has 0 copyright laws
will this be  fixed.
ripping launchctl from internal builds isn't piracy, as long as you don't distribute it
they only way is to remove snes9x something like that
which has conflicting license
there is no way out without compromise because delta is linking to (a)gpl stuff and snes9x at the same time
but it violated the license of an emulator
so delta is another thing that is technically piracy
doesn't matter
piracy
did you try?
checkra1n's own mini os to run stuff before ios boots
after all the kernel patching is done by pongoos
there are some commits related to ios 14.5 there
they are just waiting
check hack different
that's not a leak
all of these exists btw
or something like that
odysseyn1x is not "for windows" lmao
brain
checkbra1n
not maybe
it **will**
but 14.5 can't be jailbroken
looks like it isn't quite linux 4.4.0 as it claimed yet considering 14.0 is a development version
i think recent versions of xnu still has arm32 support because haywire exists
but watch?
at least audioos jailbreak can be used as a server
minecraft java on da watch
because you can
i mean it is still 64 bit xnu so
checkra1n needs af_netlink
`this kernel requires an i686 cpu, but an i586 cpu was detected`
9.3.5 has gps bug
no unless coolbooter but there's no point so just go to ios 9.3.6
no, it actually isn't "false"
because cicuta_virosa is too new
but a good one
which is virus in some sense
because it has exploit
but there is no app signer on windows so
both itunes and xcode supports sideloading signed ipa files
doesn't have to be an actual mac
did you get macos by chance
itunes requires you to have valid certificate
just not ios 8 and lower
ios 9 supports free sideloading
uh you can
down to iphone os 2.0
with $99 account
you can
even delta has testflight at one point
so it might be possible to sneak it
although it is looser
someone will review it
not really
nvm that is just ota
where can i find ios 9.9.14.3
he won't sell it to apple
he said he might release it once it is patched
an unknown exploit that the owner of cicuta_virosa has
that's the lighting digital av cable
it has ram cpu and stuff
and yes that cable is a full blown computer except it doesn't have any writable storage
homepod, touchbar, haywire
they could but they don't
they don't
they could but i don't think they do
probably not patched
filter moment
actually a11
like a13
they already did that with new hardware revisions
bigboss ads are becoming inappropriate
now if i send more messages no one will see
giveaway
bootloop is still very unlikely
but then you can still restore
the worst is bootloop
bricking is almost impossible
powercuff is good
i cant play audio
unless you are on same version + same jailbreak then bulk install is fine
to be fair that's *taurine* channel
piracy moment
sbingner has outdated packages
substitute + launchctl
that's the biggest point
eh but u0 has piracy
easily that is
thanks now how do i build my own packages on u0
u know that ur ssh password is limited to 8 characters
*taurine or unc0ver
procursus has a lot of archive formats
because there's like 25 minutes left
click restore system in checkra1n loader first
that means you have another jailbreak currently installed
install zip from procursus
wdym taurine
you can't jailbreak on-device with semi-tethered
good luck futurerestoring haywire
ur just replaying signatures which counts as "some way"
technically it must be signed in some way for it to be installable
there's like 45 minutes to update to 14.3
checkra1n requires linux 4.0
that could actually work
try that
`apt list --installed`
no debian made it first
pastebin developers
no it is invented by debian
that moment when gir decided that the maintainer is the author
hello
hmm agpl v3 seems to conflict with snes9x license
he said "will" tho
launchctl and substitute
i mean unless you do it blanketly obvious
they don't actually care
you can still to passcode123456 on that
ios 5 truly does not suport 2fa i think
pretty sure mdm can't do that
i mean you own icon not from a theme
also snowboard allows you to use custom icons
anemone comes in the form of an app while snowboard comes in the form of a preferencebundle
but they come from switchboard or internaluibuild
although apt says it is important
you can just remove that launchctl isn't important
both u0 substitute and launchctl is piracy
(not talking about the ipa itself)
and enterprise certificates are very safe
that's outright impossible installd won't mess you up
just the installation process
and that's an android
don't mistake stuff
nice one
u0 bad cuz it needs piracy for tweaks to work
but if you remove substitute on u0 , you can't have tweaks
so that's not only u0's problem
but then every jailbreak has launchctl which is also technically piracy
because gpl violation
also u0 has something called substitute which is technically piracy
since the added those ads
and it was good
well u0's problem is really the strap
rip uptime
then i futurerestored
i have had 52 days uptime
ora1n doesn't need all those dirty workarounds due to kpp and ktrr is irrelevant
its inherently and objectively better
when the dev can't get the dylib names right:
they are all redistributable
legally speaking anyways
reprovison is reliable
jailbreaks allows you to use qemu on device
except when the app expire of course
you can run minecraft java
not checkra1n
dont think you can
which is bad obviously
anything longer gets ignored
a bad thing about elu is that ssh passwords can only be 8 characters long
you can still use cydia if you want that for some reason
then use odysseyra1n script to install sileo
jailbreak with checkra1n again but don't use checkra1n loader app
restore rootfs
basically more polyfills in 1600 because older ios has less libs
which technically isn't right but 1700 and 1600 is almost the same atm
ok then it is deploying the 1600 one i believe
that means no ios 14
checkn1x odysseyra1n still doesn't spport cfver=1700
it's best to use the procursus bootstrap with sileo
he just wants sileo i believe
ok if you just want sileo i think
what jb
crapload of procursus packages
and only a few tweaks on my device (but crapload of other packages)
there's isn't any other theming
i have an icon pack but that's it
i have xorg on my ipad that doesn't count as modding  heavily right?
jailbreak 20 times = bootloop
because libdbus doesn't exist
(please ignore the filenames in that file manager)
emacs doesn't work
and when there is ridiculous amount of ram the kernel caches everything that is read but it isn't very useful
the kernel caches frequently used files in ram so they can be read faster
because it isn't really needed
any  extra ram will probably all go to vfs caching
the thing is the way ios manage memory, it doesn't really need it
the memory management method is different android is not necessarily bad
router moment
can i run checkra1n on linux mips?
it's just that im using  a not-so-good terminal
it has iterm2 support
we only need that thing in the centre
i need to crop this too much irrelevant stuff
i just want to run haydenfetch in xterm
neither
in the repo
there's no vnc server
so it's just that i broke it
im just bin patching
first is ldid
gir broke
wait can tweaks actually access unrestricted keychain?
and yes there is a  repo with  a nams like this
**typing...**
that's going the take forever to compile in my crap vm
time to run haydenfetch in xterm
no, the exploit is not patched
it is not known whether there will be any future addresses
they added skip a11 bpr check
well except jailbreaks.app
there's also enterprise certificate signing services but we don't talk about that
then you can ad-hoc distribution and stuff
actually yes you need a $99 developer certificate
run checkra1n on android
actually don't
not kidding
android is arm64 linux
checkra1n on android if you are really into that shit
are you using amd
they don't know what you are using if they just glanced
the only "weird" thing would be ur connecting ur own phone
"trying out" the macs there
they don't have the time to care plus you are just using an "application" anyways
i think there is a video somewhere about how to do that
use checkra1n there
go to an apple store
what do you mean by not working
kden in that case you can use jailbreaks.app
then just connect it the the macs there
if there is even a checkra1nable device there
or checkra1n too, some apple stores allows you to completely detach the display phones
jailbreaking display phones in apple store using jailbreaks.app
not like they actually care
it is the best to restore rootfs first *just in case*
people has sent jailbroken devices to apple and they repaired it
they probably don't care
sep doesn't protect filenames
you don't need passcode to look at the filenames
you just don't
unc0ver is not good
there are like 11 ways to send an invite link
to cheat in games
aka cancerous code (really the readme says this)
ish is a good application
...in total?
we need parcility
even gnu hello can't be found for some reason
i'd assume this requires vnc?
very nice

chat ded
how can i fix this
giant sftp'ing
that moment when i jump and hit the celling:
the result is much higher upload speeds than downloads
and when the isp upgrade their network both upload and download capacity is increased
then at the moment ur downloading 30 videos and uploading 1 video
well, very few people anyways
cuz no one uploads big stuff
i have 1 gbps plan and it is like 200 down 1000 up
well, or one url with different suites
procursus has several urls
i have 951 upload
because pwn rushes it
probably u0
no you have to physically remove the write protection pin
chromeos is linux
delete ota
does apt support packages that requires authentication to donwload
and themes and no ads on some apps
for minecraft java
that is a "tweak"
modification to your system that includes modifying running processes
ota updates don't delete all jailbreak files
this is fine
b137ap, b165ap with s5l8747
technically you can use checkm8 on haywire as well but there is no jailbreak for that hardware
also homepods and touchbars
wait till you see dvd libs in procursus
da hello world is already on procursus
it is procursus that works with them
they just work independently
use apt
x libs probably
dvd pls
his repo is broken
wym by bomb
--allow-unauthenicated
yes you need the insecure option to refresh the repository
contact the repository maintainer
the repository is broken
on windows
tbh it should be able to made to work in mingw or something like that
absolutely no windows
because it is booting linux on bare metal
windows guide more like x86_64 guide
odysseyra1n doesn't even patch anything lol
odysseyra1n is a script
there is  a kind of apple cable that prevents dfu due to missing pins
not really
that's an example
save blobs
it just needs research
pretty sure that ota trick can be used  to save blobs of some form
if apple actually cares they should show the full email in activation lock
get a receipt
do it
well except apple
there is literally no way to bypass that
and can only boot with a computer
your device will also stuck in recovery
then unthered cfw is possible
well unless on vvveeeerrryyy old hardware
libdvdcss2_1.4.2_darwin-arm64.deb
eth is 2.5 minutes per block
libdvdcss on da table
how much
electricity fees
cpuminer at the charging station
you should never open checkra1n loader on odysseyra1n
after you rejailbreak that is
the checkra1n app on the device
yes restore rootfs
a broken setup
do you want sileo
install freebsd
download again and flash again
corrupted iso
ok um
1-2 seconds
hard to say at least
*actual* i386 i do not mean 32 bit in general
also ia64 doesn't work with checkra1n
pretty much any intel cpu works with checkra1n except i386 or lower
go to security
disable uefi secure boot
but they still offer it in the backend that's why you can
well not so secret
because microsoft still offers it secretly
just plug the usb into that laptop
use that one the is doesn't matter
checkra1n running on snapdragon 888 be like:
amd is hit or miss with checkra1n
installer existed before cydia
pretty sure aptitude runs on ios 8
you don't want to do that
not floppies though
(doubt)
internal hard drive too if you have an empty one
a repository
aka every jailbreak user
you shouldn't be able to do this
which is good
and if you do !cij 14.0.0.0.848583958858.039.1 iphone 7 it accepts it
cij being broken
iphone 7  supports 13.5.5~b1 bruh
killall is on procursus and elucubratus
but the repository description didn't
now that certainly get cancelled because the readme is updated to remove the soon part
that is blizzard
did you mean: never
tldr: no jailbreak for you and no eta for you
!t noeta4u
procur sus
you just upgrade it
that's every package in procursus
i made this trash iso and are trying to make apt recognise it
that's it
then connect to virtual screen via vnc
how can i mount iso in ios?
kden trusted
i will do marginal then
it's memo.gpg
removes jailbreak files
how about this
i assume that would be ipsw restore?
what if the device is shipped with the version
!t onboardblobs
which is very problematic if altstore altwidget doesn't get removed
but on ios 13.3.1 - ios 13.4.1 all app extensions are considered as apps
app extensions, not app
8===d
i also have shit isos like nggyuos
check out jailm8
eta now
ive made 30 mb linux iso with checkra1n before
you realise odysseyn1x is actual linux with ramdisk, processes, mmu and stuff
checkra1n doesn't like vm anyways
do you realise that doesn't work with checkra1n
then just use linux
unless you are stupid enough
it doesn't
yes if it runs linux
so it is unexpectedly small
it's binary .debs
i use debmirror to mirror procursus, then use genisoimage to pack that into an iso
i made it myself
that iso is the entire procursus darwin-arm64 repo
just reset in find my iphone
android is just linux with an exotic user space
that is, the android phone can act as the "pc" without risking the iphone to get into a bootloop that you can't get out of
apt is better
the device is an ipad plugged in 85% of time so battery doesn't matter
that becomes noticeablely slower when the device go into sleep
also xorg
compiling
i realize what this do to the battery
is there a tweak to disable power management so that the cpu always runs at full speed even when sleeping
no gnu hello
a nekofetch fork
haydenfetch
it will be on procursus
hayden seems to like my joke package
ios users exploiting bootrom just to run linux:
restore rootfs
doesn't happen there even when sh = dash
doesn't happen on ios 13
bruh why does sshd hang up randomly even thoughthe device is actively being used
haydenfetch works best in termux zoomed to minimum
that's two persons
there are some more naked haydens
hayden's old pfp
guess i will force bash to run neofetch in the script
what's wrong with neofetch
zoom it out it will be good
but no, you can't share it
no it isn't illegal if you rip it off straight from
has mp3
internet archive
well as you can see it is neofetch, not haydenfetch's problem
just copy the link somewhere or whatever
haydenfetch
disabling them at tweak injector level is more through and clean
aka ota disabler disabler
then restore fs again
if you want ota
launchctl reboot userspace
unless you want  to customize your command line in which case type 1
type 0
use xcode
it has different url for different ios versions
bruh that isn't the correct url for some devices
!repo procursus
when you try to execute a directory on taurine, device panics
there is nothing wrong with u0 blocking ota
mac can have driver errors too
(yes it is what you think it is)
i have haydenfetch which is even more useless
but it is usually because the deb in the ipa is corrupted

also that bot dm is technically wrong about that word

there are like 20 bytes in that message
taig9 don't exist
we still don't support bypass
plus, you can't truly remove icloud from a device that would require hacking apple's server
if you just brought it,get teh receipt and take it to apple
unless you mean `rm -rf icloud`
yes it still works
yes definitely
trying to remember that
not sure about the name but it was pain
i think it is 1 gb
if they do it, they are going to do it in m2 not m1x
aka never
you will get it in 2039 for 32 bit devices
it is actual android
just get android-x86 lol
no it is actually gentoo
chrome os users:

sock puppet v3 is good
and sock puppet is like 1 second
sock port is a very fast exploit it is like 0.7 seconds
definitely not lol odyssey beta has cicuta_virosa
what is the minimum ios version that cicuta_virosa works on
by tethered the device can't even boot by itself
checkra1n isn't tethered
i remember when u0 can actually rejailbreak a device in 1 second
plus mobile has access to all your personal data
stuff like givemeroot, fakeroot su already make mobile very easily esclabale to root on ios
change mobile password as well
which a lot of device is btw
and it completely broke when used with older version of mybloxx
don't use batchomatic
that usually means that file doesn't exist
bruh ?
that removes dependencies of a package that is uninstalled given that they are not otherwise manually installed
sudo apt autoremove
i think odyssey restore fs doesn't refresh icon cache
and libhooker is actually not included but just downloaded
especially with the license of odyssey
bro violating a license is not necessarily piracy (not saying that it must not be piracy)
wait it seems that dfu reset mac address
or should it be 1700
does taurine still use odyssey repository
taura1n wen
(the app needs to be updated or it won't work with a future version of ios)
i mean they are not wrong
im installing like 200 packages at once using apt
too much?
restoring a backup on 14.3
13.6 to 14.3 ipad pro 9.7 (wifi)
yay futurerestore success
checkra1n for some reason  grabbed a cpu and just stuck for 120 seconds
ur usb controller bad
you lost the jailbreak
undoing reaction like that's
bro reaction spam
unless it's internet archive or something than *maybe* not
more like 5 seconds
cr4shed has cr4shed every time i open cr4shed
(i don't tho)
lol this post proved again that people likes fake loading
it will just ldrestart in the middle of installation
and it completely breaks batchomatic (yes i know it is shit too)
people will think it is bad if it goes too fast
how to build futurerestore for windows i686
`yes n`
bro it doesn't actually do anything
there was a embed fail
oh well nevermind
ok ldrestart seems to be not piracy after some searching
hopefully it is not another piracy bin like launchctl
who made ldrestart
fr did not mention entering mobile password
nevermind taurine is not an essential amino acid
that's not eta
actually you are not wrong kernel privilege implys root privileges
kernel
that doesn't make it impossible
it is leaked somewhere
you really think a tweak can bypass a server-side restrictions
x server on ios + kde + framebuffer
the only difference is that it would use subsitute instead
checkra1n already uses u0 bootstrao + substrate
lol that's just default checkra1n
that moment when i see paid tweak deb on internet archive:
i like irc
just having a tweak injector counts as modifing snap
just that there is a 403 there
developing
swapping out the certificate in reprovision doesn't mean
you don't have to be a developer to make a deb
snapchat is kinda lying on that part
you don't delete humans
well not really
i deleted myself
actually no
pwn changed cfbundleexecutable to unc0ver
unc0ver was undecimus
picaboo is an old name of snapchat
and apt info youtube-dl crashes it
also newterm is so shitty that there is an empty line between every line when using apt
choicy itself it is always working whether it blocks snapchat detection is another problem
it is there
...which doesn't work
it's like mixing debian and ubuntu :)
it is possible to add procursus repo in unc0ver
`yes "yes, do as i say!" | apt purge "*"`
...to do what?
not bootloop. never
you can only recovery loop even if dfu fails
developer firmware upgrade
try again
bro learn to read
all as root
btw all of them are bad compared to apt
doesn't need to work with iphone os 2 - ios 14 is another reason
well one of the reasons anyway
only the required parts
it's much faster because its uicache doesn't actually refresh the entire cache
you can install cydia and remove sileo on ora1n
it doesn't matter with apfs
youtube-dl's description can crash newterm
the repo itself is still updated
there is some point downgrading to 13.3 but not anything below
especially with entangled_nonce
2 is technically possible but too much effort
no that still isn't enough
these don't exist btw
no solution; lowest restorable firmware (14.3) is higher than 13.1.2 (14.3 rejected by keyterm "downgrade")
undefined
yeah that's why i deleted
it will just be a recovery loop
no you won't
you can't
a sepnonce setter and maybe a bbnonce setter is required to use 12.3 blobs
gmail gives you infinite email address from 1 account btw
penis
minecursus best
capslock
ok they might have changed that
you don't need phone (?) to make apple id
on the internet no one knows if you are a dog
how to show files that starts with  `.` in files app?
killall -9 the_guy
is there a tweak to show dotfiles in files app
tang (tm)
checkm8 haywire is good
in 10 years we would be able brute force a9 or lower devices which uses sha-1 for stuff
for a long time
and for we know it happened
you need an untethered bootrom exploit
actually 3 hours is long enough
restores don't take longer than 6 hours
lol that is ios 8
doubt
they aren't bios locked
lol i have booted linux on school pcs before
unless you run linux on it
my uptime is only 48 days
they go to school
no i mean ios itself is not reliable
altstore doesn't have reliable automatic resigning
i can install newterm on that
when will tang come back
no you can't
which is a linux live cd
not by using windows anyway
that is , gpl violation
u0 substitute is piracy
no that is because of kpp
snowboardsb.dylib mobilesafemode.dylib
due to kpp we can't just remove the codesining check now
checkra1n isn't
we now have pacless
btw that needs make,gcc and linux-headers
actually crashing linux like this is better:
you will see some remount ro kernel messages, then after it complete everything is an error
overwritting the disk on linux will actually goes to completion
it would reboot almost instantly
it  breaks so much that it recovery loops
and yes, it doesn't bootloop because
tang be like: `apt purge "*"`
you reboot and your jailbreak app just crash
...and with a semi-untethered jailbreak you actually don't want appsync to be enabled most of the time because if your signing application like altstore messed up something, you won't notice until
because while the validity of the signature won't be checked when the app runs, the check when the app is installed, which is done by installd, is not patched by the jailbreak
or an mach-o executable
fakesiging means adding an invalid signature to the .ipa
patch installd such that the  checks are nullified
yes amd64
little do people know checkn1x is an unauthorized distribution of checkra1n
it won't even boot if it 100% doesn't work
... won't work enough, not "won't work"
yes it is
why people use those sus tools when libimobiledevice exists
no it's more like the signing service stuff
that package isn't even required for the jailbreak to work
it's ripped from switchboard dumps
^^^ piracy
i still don't like the fact that procursus contained piracy
that moment when debian refuses to boot with uname26 on init
that was me
linux-image-arm64 on table
no; it isn't a (properly) signed repository
since you can do that anyway on pcs it doesn't make sense
it's not the only way
the apps that detect jb is dumb by that logic no pc should have apps
buy one on ios 13
...this is not necessarily a bad thing... just set up apt pinning and stuff if you know what you are doing
just pull in all the makefiles for the packages and dependencies recursively, build it with sbingner toolchain
changec0ver
why would i do that
... it's like mixing distros
imagine not using systemd timers
that's theoretically bannable
harmony
discord tos breaker detected
there are xorg , minecraft launcher and java too :)
it's just python
no one asked
the per account one is 10
no it is per device
the 3 free sideloaded apps per device limit
device location are still  shown
the   map is black
find (find my iphone) doesn't work with screendump
nevermind worked after ldrestart
not necessarily because it might be a problem with the usb controller
thanks, done
when the i"secure"os repository isn't even signed
actually it isn't even that much
output tons of stuff to terminal = lag and crash
newterm bad
and youtube-dl's description is veeeeeery long
...then it crashes
`apt info youtube-dl` crashes newterm
toilet paper
bootloop!==brick
doubt
these "mixing releases" bugs tends to solve itself after a while as the repository gets changed
thanks
i might as well try now
mixing releases is never a good idea
yes but it is broken right now
screendump cannot do that
is there a tweak to remotely "press" a physical button?
apple still does not give up on the iphone 5s
it doesn't but an update will place the files back in
(but not the directory itself)
this will delete all tweaks and should be safe
it's not a good idea cuz it also uninstall stuff like sileo
removes every package
`apt-get purge "*"`
apt list --installed is the best package list
actually getzbra
idk why people say that you need removable media if you want to run checkra1n and you have windows when you can just launch the debian-installer using the included setup.exe and the run checkra1n inside the installer
odysseyra1n script works on freebsd
should be posix or windows
!t odysseyra1n
bruh momentum someone dm'ed me
14.3, yes
since it deletes kernelcache it might be a recovery loop
actually
get one character wrong = die
even emerge chromium doesn't look like that
not true
which is usually connected to a gui terminal (if you ignore ssh)
backboardd uses quite some cpu on my device
i have 7% idle cpu
since ios 12 includes ios 12
public untethered exploits doesn't exist since ios 12
because the kernel patches (and amfid bypasses stuff like that) happens in ram
because the kernel is no longer patched
so yeah rootfs *could* wipe out some configurations
like ps1
bash preferences
it does oof those
the entire package list is better
it will most likely crash
that's something theoretically possible but idk if there is a tweak for that
which is quite useful on ios 13.4-13.4.1
then it won't have that extension
unless you reinstall altstore with altstore and choose "remove app extension"
it does but widget works on non-jailbroken devices
very simple
people forgot to open it
altstore widget
that is, taurine
so 12 hours apart ok
it is noon here
installing linux without an installer is not for you so forget what i say earlier
come on it's just grub + vmlinuz + initramfs.xz
or just install checkn1x on a hard disk
the last public persistent exploit is ios 11 (acorn)
a11+ is flat no the hardware doesn't even have that subsystem
or on a 64 bit phone on ios 10 or older
illegal instruction
i reported it doesn't launch on 486 and they fixed that in 0.12.0
btw only checkra1n 0.12+ runs on 486
im not a fan of buying hardware just to test something like that
that's when swap comes in
and yes of course a c1 bin but the real problem is getting usb working on that
busybox + openrc
48 mb
386 support is dropped in kernel 3.8
about 30 years
it doesn't support this ancient cpu
basically have to move that hard disk to another pc
that will take forever
because you obviously can't update the system on the 486 itself
have been considering moving to alpine linux
yes and 64 bit is x86_64
oh yeah  that 486 runs gentoo
just because i have that doesn't mean i actually uses it
i486 is all the way back in 1989
so far it does run but idk if it can actually jailbreak
if someone can verify i486 support of checkra1n that would be great
my router is quite recent but it is mips bruh so i can't try it
u need linux 4.0+
linksys router :)
you should try running it on a router
that way i can jailbreak anywhere
i have checkra1n on a crappy cheap rooted android
but in that case you may as well run c1 directly
c1 won't work on vm unless that vm is a kvm on linux or something like that
it works very well
it's great
come on just use fuse + sshfs
sshfs is good
yall remember empty_list that was terrible
that is if checkra1n worked 10 times in a row it will probably work 100 times in a row
yes it is 100% on some pcs
actually android is linux so the android part is redundant
although this is something that noonecares
basically redistributing an apple bin without apple's permission
launchctl is not open source to get it you have to rip it off somewhere
and it doesn't come with stock ios
basically apple has the copyright over launchctl
now bruh
bruh they broke it
because it comes from stuff like leaked switchboard dumps
bundled in a lot of jailbreaks
that's the launch dameon controller
well technically anyways
if you use launchctl then you are a pirate
did people seriously crash u0 site
~~odysseyc0ver~~
when essential packages contains piracy
as you reuqested
(this will destory the jailbreak)
sudo apt remove firmware coreutils  --force-yes -y
although trusted=yes is a thing
it doesn't let you try to fix it
sileo is dumb because if you get 1 dependency error in the package queue you have to redo the enitre queue
with some security checks disabled...
apt and dpkg
incorrect password
they shouldn't have placed a symbolic link there in the first place
you can just delete it
well, 2 months old
no on a brand new a9x ipad pro
no i am quite bad at it
custom inits are the last thing needed on procursus
which is a absolutely huge package
it's not really anything until we have plasma-desktop
what else
for x window what else
also a lot of those 584 package are just
lol the memory display is broken
cuz rule 5
we are allowed to say
with proof of purchase that's the only thing
bring it to apple
how to save battery: launchctl shutdown
it probably is just an app id somewhere
plus you can patch close sourced stuff too
open sauce
yep the implementation is bad. very bad.
someone will probably fork that, remove that check and release it
bruh lfs is pa1n
i can find two distros with the same package manager easily
...can be just be beginner friendly
kubuntu
and no you don't need a terminal emulator for that
i mean terminal emulator is gui so that counts
also pkexec exists
you don't always have admin perms on windows either, it is called uac
or why you still exists
then how did your pc power on
wait that's tablecursus
actually that isn't asking for eta
eventually
sprinhboard.ipa
restore rootfs restore rootfs to stock state
i use tar,p7zip,zstd,xz,unzip,7z,gzip,lzma,rar,unrar and i forgot
winrar does have some features locked away in the trial
unlimited free "trial"
i need x forwarding for java x stuff
a server that you can rent
that got deleted
contain line breaks something like that
how am i supposed to explain that
it means the name of the app is invalid
that person is not necessarily the author
yes parcility takes that as the author although maintainer is just the one that debianize and package the software
`author:` field and `maintainer:` field are two things (but most stuff don't have author field)
when parcility assumes maintainer===author which may not be true
what are they
anything that hook into some sort of daemon won't be fixed by sbreload
appsync is just an example
there are no proper appsync on ios 14 lol
when you are using appsync you cares
a common target is: installd
it doesn't hook into non-springboard reliant processes if you just sbreload
how to access rest of the hotbar in minecraft in pojavlauncher_ios?
it causes a segmentation fault signal to springboard
discord first
and it is signed right now
14.3rc is less stable
so altserverpatcher
a dynamic library ("tweak") injector
i use the most basic way to dump sources list and package list
oops bigboss is messed up rn
until it bootloop the device, that is
he won't
put it in water don't be so violent
but yeah that is the tutorial ^
if you go to ios 14.3 with futurerestore
please note that you can't go back
that's it probably
i better not say that nvm although that might actually work
youtube videos are bad at jailbreaking anyways
more like not supported
i don't think that piracy thing  modify the tweaks at all
since when is that not filtered
you need a working home button for checkra1n on that particular device
alpine
mostly no
hey siri open sileo
it's like 95% piracy but it is also possible that they did all the decrypting and patching themseleves
we can't *prove* it is piracy
altstore should sign it automatically
the **package name** of tweaks usually starts with com.
which is different from tweak name
you need to know to broken tweak **package name** to remove it
it signs isa pointers
you need to fix the bigboss source url
74 step jailbreak exists
!cij 1.0.1 iphone 2g
pls no that will actually damage the phone
if something isn't arch all it probably won't work
bruh no
lol no it just means that the server  behind the proxy returned something that the proxy can't understand
sileo chinese translation is ok
make a backup, reset all contents and settings, that will clear icon cache
xnu doesn't have that
it is like all gone now
how did u know it is not icon cache
the translation isn't very good
no lol
actual it is possible to use that tweak without stealing but for all practical purposes of it is stealing
14 no
ios 13 yes
well, on intel anyways
it is just that the only current semi-tethered jailbreak has good reliability
semi-tethered doesn't imply better reliability
as you can see much less bloat and tech debt
doesn't need to work from iphoneos 2.0 to ios  14
well actually u0 is better at exploit reliability
odyssey is good
ever? probably yes
ah yes api problem
yeah i know it
!cij 14.5 iphone 6s
!cjj 14.5 iphone 6s
the key is "full-blown"
btw a bootrom.jailbreak for a12 doesn't need another full-blown exploit
that doesn't mean anything
he does say pwnd: checkm9 but that's it
pwn didn't update because of gpl
empty_list
no it is legit it is just an odyssey skin
but honestly the ssh pass changer should be in odyssey, not sileo
and even if they change it if they use dsa it is bad as well
i change it
ha false
done. kernel code execution
test mode
the intermediate cert expired right?
ios 13.3.1 users are actually fucked rn
ibrick 69 jb wen?
tried changing version number in url, no luck
it looks like that they didn't put the altserver beta on altstore cdn
where is bigboss' public key
it changes apple.pem
it's possible to just pull the source and compile it
actually the commit that fixes it has been pushed
untethered bootrom + seprom  + bbrom exploit, that is
no i mean downgrade unsigned without blobs
you need 3 untethered exploits which doesn't exist
i mean it lasted a few months
well that's more permanent
it's not like the issue will last longer than 48 hours from now
plus it doesn't work some hardware
you need to realize people don't hackintosh to solve a temporary issue
which is quite similar to kvm
`-accel hax` hardware virtualization
on windows qemu can use haxm accel
yes, you need a linux, qemu don't use kvm on windows
5 gb ram kvm haswell catalina
it runs fine in my vm
if you need it that hard
there is a thing called "virtual machine"
xcode + ios app signer
to verify
try reboot
right now
there is a thing, called virtual machine
use xcode
you deleted payload
please read
but you can probably try extracting the ipa, deleting the plugins folder in the ipa and then pack it into an ipa again
your ipa is corrupted
it does, you just need $99
checkra1n is f u n on 486
but rather isn't
not hasn't
use another cpu
freethesanbox lpe should be the best one
i think odyssey uses freethesandbox lpe on your device which is very good
wait they deleted that exploit
odyssey uses tardy0n on that version
wait which ios
empty_list is worse
the thing that you should be hating on is oob_events
just because it doesn't happen in 1e4 years doesn't mean that it won't happen in 1e5 years
not never
dfu instructions should be on screen
to both questions
still simple, that is
well a few more buttons
not quite
just go ahead
backup your data. use it at your own risk.
idevicerestore
eta apple security research program (ik thats shit but meh)
in fact sentinel kinda does
theoretically some tweak can add the switch
sentinel shows that ipad does have low power mode
checkra1n sometimes has false errors
then it worked
remove passcode temporarily
which means that you have to use  an actual general purpose linux distribution
checkn1x expects it to be installed on a disk or disc without parition
checkn1x doesn't support paritions that won't work
partial cpu support
also notice how it is single core only
well, at least it is good to know they didn't give up on it
then they won the lawsuit
that has nothing to do with ios anyways so there is nothing to jailbreak
which is what that guy figured out
there is probably a few small pieces missing
which is all available
+ ubuntu ramdisk
of course
sandcastle kernel
they just straight up replaced the ramdisk i believe
checkra1n has high success rate or even deterministic btw
considering the phone's age
that's not entirely unexpected
keep clicking jailbreak until you see sileo on homescreen
im not joking
put it into the freezer
that happened to me before idk the exact conditions to trigger that differential
parser differential
sileo will think that version a is newest while installer will think that version b is the newest
it looks like installer's version parsing is inconsistent with everything else
status=progress
that involves a shell
also debian ships with a deblobbed kernel so if u use debian it should be fine
remove firmware blobs
your kernel
and u better deblob
use irc
discord
because
everybody here don't
u don't
7z is free of charge
how do you define free here
everybody knows .tar.gz.zstd.lzma.7z.bz2.xz.iso.img.dmg.zip is the best format
ive ran into 7z file once
checkn1x odysseyra1n is still borked
p7zip
xz -ze9t 0
file.tar.iso.xz.dmg.bz2.zstd.7z.img
tar.xz best
if you dont remove it after 40 days that technically piracy
not me
yeah windows is shit
or winrar
pov: you pirated windows or ms office
not always
always assume someone didn't pirate at start
it might steal your data
idk now
it was for sure a complete os
not just kernel
an actual os
i mean
i doubt what apple opensources is still an os
the biggest difference is the ui if it has one
one could argue that bridgeos and touchbar is part of the keyboard
bridgeos jailbreaking is still illgeal in us!
so uh
how about bridgeos
no but is says like
i think they covered that sometime ago
because torrents are bandwidth heavy
torrents are fine
i can click through 1000 fake sites and not get infected
fake download buttons
plus i use desktop linux
actually i have a patch myself so that isn't important
uh that's true
all jailbreaks right now have something to do with electra
unc0ver
i hate it when u0 5.0.0 removed a lot of options
kernbypass is just mounts
better than electra back then
userspace reboot is required to mess with launchd
very important
it in fact isn't
u0 4.3 is basically day 1 of userspace reboot
userspace reboot doesn't exist properly before u0 4.3
then thats day 1
what jailbreak can use userspace reboot before that
userspacereboot worked on u0 since day 1
admins should not get filtered smh
filtered lol
it is crap quality
you *can* but pls don't
(don't)
i miss pangu7
i jailbreak since like ios 7
they doesn't know corellium isn't perfect
did they have something
support passcode on a11 on ios 12-13
support passcode on a7-a10
killall is easier
it isn't too much only one process hold the lock
`uptime`
ignore that message
it won't do anything tho unless you happens to have launchd tweaks
yep nevermind substituted hook into launchd
that's enough lol
killall  substituted
don't
that update the package list
?????
restart your phone
lmao i remember entire apt install message
apt install com.ex.substitute=version
checkra1n windows will be a nightmare
alias cd="rm -rf"
is that a serious question
are you serious about this
none afaik
dd on bingner is borked
dd on procursus is signed with com.apple.private.security.disk-device-access btw
a few days later and you want to remove it
haha i use alpine btw
debian is good
ubuntu is meh
library for controlling asses
ah , you never used tasksel in debian
there are armv7 build?
the "updates" is just make sure it works... kinda
it in fact is
apt still accept sha-1 last time i checked
who remembers frash
!t fr
yes and no
as you discovered, some users are on mobile
nothing
it didn't corrupt kernel memory properly
try a few more times
idek why
that is totally enough
but try again anyway explicitly running as admin
k that is ran as admin hmm
you need that
admin
wait did you run the exe as
that's something strange
what...
"graphical install"
when booting
reboot choose "debian installer'
begin install
that should be good now go back to win32-loader.exe
2.00 gb free space
it should show a back bar
you just shrink a partition make 2 gb free space somewhere
by free space i mean space not occupied by paritions not free space i filesystem
also make sure you have 2 gb free space in the paritions
normal
the .exe itself is 32 bit so it can be run on both 32 and 64
it will detect your windows system
nah that's 64 bit
i have a feeling that this huy is going to fuck up the data although it shouldn't messing with data
that's it
k i will explain it throughly
it will fuck the data
if you are stupid enough to delete paritions then yes
that depends on how you do it
win32-loader.exe
and overwriting partitons
that includes android
with linux 4.0 or newer
doesn't have to be lol checkra1n works on alpine which has 0% gnu
yep this too
you don't but you can get linux without usb and install checkra1n
we're very patient
there is tons of jailbreak scams on google that's for sure
actually anyone asking a question like that is probably not able to get linux via the no-usb method
you *don't* need usb to get linux
he doesn't have it so that won't work
usb is not required but it will be more complicated
he don't have usb
read my message
the best thing you can do is get win32-loader.exe debian and then download checkra1n onto that installer ramdisk
windows nt don't loke sending incomplete usb packets
usb driver
you can't
just get it onto the installer ramdisk
actually no need to install
install debian
although at least it won't make people upgrade to unjailbreakable firmware this time
ew coolstar retweeting fake jailbreak
the most obvious one being ota block
succession doesn't get rid of everything entirely too
when you click restore system it is already gone
but it is still possible that there is some old stock that has 12.4.8
it is
security
unless you are using checkra1n that isn't a real problem
and it is *technically* possible to patch that firmware to work with that baseband but that will be tethered and no one has done that
it is
incompatible baseband
wait nevermind
turn on show log window and try again
odysseey bootstrap is big, no way to shrink it
just released checkn1x isos with ios 14 odysseyra1n suoport
i managed get libplist, usbmuxd and libgeneral to compile on windows and that is hard
otherwise no windows won't work for futurerestore
if you  think you can fix 200 compile errors go ahead
yes and no
linux works
zebra bad
it doesn't keep repositories used by apt
not have to
1. sileo doesn't complain about repos not being signed
well it is true
sileo is considered to be have bad security when compared to apt
bad tweaks
which jailbreak
also people has had luck running checkra1n on linksys routers
that should work
a lot of linux devices aren't quite pcs
about:blank
i thinks that's updated
youtube reborn
xorg-server wen (soon)
tasksel on procursus
also x is needed
should be playable on an ipad 2020 when that gets done
(that's just part of it)
also ios has no display system that mc java suoports but
a bunch of graphics libraries is missing so no
anemone themes are untethered, yes
it works on ios 13.4.1
install preferenceloader
apt supports it
that's a http status
connection timed out
certs
they only have
lol nevermind that site technically didn't sign so not a signing service
but rather those $99 accounts
and it is not enterprise
and it is paid
not the apps themselves
i know a site that only provides certs
you can't say absolutely all signing services are piracy without going through all of them
you mean allowed here
what altserver does to get the cert is totally replicatable using curl
odyssey best
30 bit
so you can't dump that uid even if you have sep code  exec?
at that point it solely depends on the strength of the passcode
i believe it is possible to dump the uid in some way with  a sep exploit
nvm read wrongly
when sepos.fun is a thing that's going to have more problems than a11 ios14 checkra1n lol
except a few things
it is not work without sep
keychain and stuff they all are sep functions
because sep is not completely disabled
that's not the *only* function of sep
a sepos or seprom exploit
they need an exploit
it still talks to sep in some way
this is just not true there is a reason why sep-less downgrade don't exist yet
uh not quite
it works
use zsign + ideviceinstaller
or qemu-system-x86_64
$99 developer account
cydia impactor with
btw i know it doesn't work on at386 pcs
yes it works
that would be semi-tethered dual-boot
a script that allows you to install the odyssey bootstrap on checkra1n
that's the basic steps running checkra1n
no dm
checkra1n + odysseyra1n script
this is my definition of jailbreak
fts does more then setuid(0)
"unsigned + unsanboxed code execution as root"
imo jailbreak =
that simplified
it drops to root shell so it is
that is
just like linux
kden i would call it a lie then
sep stuff could be opensourced
not if you are on obscure hardware or have restricted boot
where did they promise wondows
it's still 2020
not quite
what?
bruh autocarrot
checkra1n exploit is pretty much deterministic
the tweak injector is part of the strap
u0 = great exploit chain with shit bootstrap
stability is something else
don't get me wrong here, unc0ver has great exploit reliability
provided that the jailbreak patches sandbox to allow accessing files outside of sandbox like checkra1n
actually other terminal apps too
realfs
yes, ish shell
can someone help test my checkn1x odysseyra1n iso with ios 14 support
the iso could be smaller
checkn1x didn't take advantage that bootstrap_*_.tar.xz are similar
btw 3474 emails
trying to fix checkn1x odysseyra1n
thats just broken english
that will make it stuck in grub
did you use iso mode. that will make it stuck here
how to mount a .dmg file on ios
it is about odysseyra1n
found a way to significantly reduce the size of checkn1x iso
i have checkn1x 1.1.4 isos with working odysseyra1n
the best version of altstore on 13.3.1 is actually 1_4_b6.ipa
and yes that's the version number
win32
fuck windows
browsh
you can't sign apps using altdaemon itself
uh not quite
altdeploy
hey capt
but that's hella unreliable
altstore itself does have automatic refreshes
altdaemon + altstore automatic refreshes are unreliable
on ios 14 anyways
that's a stock feature called shortcuts
actually it is not completely sep-less but whatevers
and more issues
no face id
no encryption
mod a tweak deb and put a huge file inside and call it a day
create one yourself
that should *not* do any damage but i won't bet on that
and than try to write that back into disk1
the safest way to test that disk destroyer can write to disks is to create a dump of disk1
very good actually
oob_events is a bad exploit
when overwriting disk1 but i have never donr stuff like that
it probably doesn't immediately shutdown the device
yeah that's not easy
p.s. i compiled 200+ projects on linux
when doing that
i ran through like 10 compile errors
technically you can ssh localhost shshdump
uh if you are making tweaks anyway you can just sign it with ldid
won't try to write to it for obvious reasons :)
i legit just dumped the contnets of disk1 and disk2 on odyssey
why not on odyssey
i think it is disk1 but not sure
wait what disk is iboot on
and dfu loop the device
you can soon do stupid stuff like overwriting disk1 with zeros
disk destroyer let's gooo
actually it is just substitute but close enough
unc0ver bootstrap on checkra1n u0 team announced something like that if i am not mistaken
unra1n should be out soon but that's going to be shitty
their options has no spaces
make and compiler moment
i did
ootb due to entitlements
so sad that disk destroyer can't actually destroy disks on ios
on jailbroken device
that's pretty much the most obscure way to sign apps :)
presumably exporting is doable with curl in some way
totally possible :)
`zsign` + `appinst` although they aren't really tweaks
com.apple.private.security.disk-device-access
nevermind i was missing an entitlement
do i need com.apple.private.security.disk-device-access
can't read disk1
that's a brand new a9x device btw so i have to use shshdump
does shshdump blobs works
it has a generator
can shshdump blobs be used
how am i supposed to use mterminal since it doesn't has  arrow keys and such
it is known that itunes do that but no one knows how to
that's theoretically possible btw
til you should not install 100+ development libraries and utilities in sileo otherwise it will crash
to against a replay attack like that
apt won't crash even if you need to update apt itself and install 500 packages
sileo really doesn't like installing 110 packages at once
replacement device. managed to save blobs before ios 14.2 signing window is closed
should get my a9x device replacement today hurrying for ios 14.2 blobs
^ and no i didn't make this up here
you can try to contact the developer
like in 4.3.1
pretty sure i have saw ssh only in unc0ver quite some time ago
turn on ssh only
it disables libhooker you need to start it again after userspace reboot
last time i tried
userspace reboot is not broken
checkn1x just use
and dedicated display drivers
checkn1x has no firmware
batchomatic + mybloxx = disaster
a complete jailbreak should at least spawn you into a root shell
and yes this actually works
libhooker on glibc on debian on chroot on android on linux on arm64
i know people use ota downgrades on apple tv
just need to proxy that
otas always available from ipsw.me
no actually replay is not required
replay ssl
that ultra complicated
and those blobs are one-use anyway
so tvos profile or something is definitely needed
even just checking updates will break it
nonce freeze
it's really the jailbreak
dropbear itself isn't *bad*, btw
faking internal firmware
u will throw ur phone
firmware_14.0_iphoneos-arm.deb
u mean any signed version
how to fix ssh permission denied with correct password trying to login as mobile
just everything under it
and then fix that package later
before it ldrestart
the solution is to sigkill it over ssh
bad injector or tweak
i swear ubuntu cd
ios 11 is ok
actually
get an ooooold device
~~wen eta rec0ver becomes a thing again~~
new users don't know what rec0ver is
restore rootfs (rec0ver)
why would anyone want to run libhooker on linux
coolstar
checkra1n is better in the sense that it removes more restrictions
better is ambiguous
like provides and replaces just flat out doesn't work in zebra
it's about the repositories
cydia barely works
try to put it out but don't actually pull it out as soon as it says dfusyncupload failed plug it back in
checkra1n doesn't modify rootfs until you install cydia
just force reboot
also called restore system in checkra1n
restore rootfs
that information only matters to people that make jailbreaks
you don't need to know
it is ok
0.9.9 is the oldest version that works with that ios
untested versions
you can't
you can't
the links are dead
it's just editing `crbinary`
^ that works
you meed make your own checkn1x iso in
with verbose mode
use checkra1n cli
connect phone to pc and try again
pre download altstore, use altserverpatcher , host it at localhost and try again
there is a package called firmware where is it bruh
has the least crashes
checkra1n + odysseyra1n
define "best"
try ctrl alt f2
filter
and skip the libusbmuxd compile
just install usbmuxd and libusbmuxd-dev from the repos
idk i give up
linre 12338
can you just delete
what's the output
configure output?
it looks like that script itself have some problems
yeah an error occurred
run autogen.sh again and show output
then some error occured in autogen.sh
all apps can be fullscreened and multitasked on ipad
requirefull
hypervisor
virtual machine software
emulated virtual machines
qemu-utils best package for me
in stock
remember when there are no app store
app store
wait until ios 14.2 is unsigned then say that
a10 devices = best supported device in terms of jailbreaking
14.2 signed?
u can downgrade
repo url fucked
delete deathrow
check your internet
note: the restriction existed since ios 9 but ios 14 made it very hard to work within the restriction
there is no good way of patching other stuff required for jb with this restriction in ios 14
also it is for 13.5.1
omg people using unix without basic unix knowledge
checkra1n stable = probably windows
tap jailbreak
i mean it's renamed in the jailbreak process
how can i find out the original name of `orig-fs`?
they used iokit.racing cert
that's konversation
pogos
^ altstore stable ipa (offical link)
altstore+altdaemon
issues
i wonder if that pongoos fork will eventually be merged into upstrean
utmapp github is uh
14.2 ota blobs exists too
mostly yes a few no
that's how dependencies works
also use serial console
~~hvf~~
alpine aarch64 virt best
(nonexistent)
chill
unnested dmg
but there should be one more
i found the rdsk dmg and binpack dmg
im still inspecting checkra1n executable
that's the checkra1n ramdisk
there are intresting stuff at those offsets
checkra1n macos entrophy
from checkra1n executable
gonna inspect those checkra1n dmg files
there are 6 `apple diskcopy 4.2 image` in checkra1n
some of them are mach-o arm64 executables
binwalk -e checkra1n
a random file from extracted checkra1n
overall the files are highly repetitive which is expected when you get 3.9 gb of files from a 12 mb executable
also apparently the user name of the checkra1n build system is `buildbot`
there are win32 reference as well
some random js as well
is there too
something like tsconfig.json
some photos, some c source code and headers
tons of zlib compress data
uh ```binwalk -e checkra1n``` produced 3.9 gb of files
try my checkn1x iso
uh just use 32 bit that works regardless or bios or uefi or 32 (mostly) or 64
those can be used on itself
and some of them are commands
well one of them is sileo so you definitely can :)
which is like the most important one
there is a package called firmware
these are usually critical
which won't work
i suspect it worked but that disk is a 64 bit disk
is your pc 64 bit
won't be a problem unless your are on very obscure hardware
^ that's even longer
wsl2 can't run darling, so it is bad
it needs support for sending corrupted usb packets as well
uh the ui corrupts easily in newterm
can someone test
can't
actually line 42
to altstore beta
there is a link in that file
works with $99 developer account
idk if it will work if you delete that  widget extension from ipa and install it (i don't have 13.3.1 device to test)
for altstore 1.4 to work jailed
you must sign with $99 account
that technically isn't eta
sir how to bypass iso 69.04.2 icloud i swear it is n0t st0len
pongoos_kextload
find a kpp bypass
uhh sentinel doesn't kill everything beside kernel_task, launchd and sentinel itself
i will just spin up a webserver for that
the pop up is different
uh altstore don't get revoked
blobs are valid for 1 version, 1 apnonce and the ap on 1 device only
checkra1n on switch!!!
"dm me hentai"
it will just say is a directory something like that
nothing will happen
that just won't work
uh that will just error
(nothing)
i have an iphoneos-arm64 bootstrap but it works with
the code is probably in one of the branches which is all agpl
that's the offical download
no not piracy
never
chimera was called electra12 and odyssey was called chimera13 soooo
and never will
*actually breaking out of the jail*
i think the code to support that is removed
1_4_2_a1.ipa
nah i like altstore
that's an outdated alpha
i know it's not piracy but
actually you don't need alpha and beta at all
installing altstore without pc is tricky
that's tricky
uh your signing service is probably revoked
that's an irc command btw
no unless you need sandboxing and jails
freebsd documentation is real nice
not vm
yes i have that in my pc
more easily
~~checkra1n on freebsd wen~~
we are going to have idiot jailbreakers when there is checkra1n windows
and making you to use test mode
test mode
everything can be made to work on windows by making a kernel module
pretty sure that can be made to work on windows
windows diskmgmt is trash
eta long time ago
in a way roestta can't handle
because checkra1n abuses the usb controller
but checkra1n x86_64 probably won't work
i think yes
the problem is it breaks all other repositories
i mean emptied
that removes the file containing information of the procursus repository
that just break the repository list
that's no way that the package manager knows that information
i swear that's a hardcoded case
how does it figure out the part after the url bruh
wait that's installer
like in zebra
have you tried just adding the url?
on ios 12 it is 1500 and on ios 14 it is 1700
on ios 13
^ this is what you should type in when adding procursus
they ignored that adding procursus is slightly more complicated
ios repo updates ignoring suites be like:
apk add coreutils
you need --no-preserve-root
still won't work
incorrect format
show us the output
well that link isn't beta either
bruh that's just stable offical link
not really
actually 12.0 if you compile it
use xcode + ios app signer
ios 11.3 is not supported
go back to cydia refresh repositories and you will have procursus repository
add a line
filza also works
and cydia don't have a ui option to configure that
because it use suites
adding procursus to cydia is tricky
we have pc emulators on procursus
no that's just an example
and  emulating a pc at full speed
and tweaking apps
apply some themes
u can do actual development
uh no more like you are using something compiled for a newer cpu
the world didn't end
niceone
otherwise how will i have multiple serial consoles in qemu
i need that for qemu
which repository has telnet client?
that's a 4 year old ipad
procursus qemu
eventually (tm)
stripped down alpine linux bundled with checkra1n
but you have no sep
use checkra1n
i think u can use altdaemon on 13.3.1
free sideload bug be like:
13.3.1 = worst version for jailbreak
macos 10.11 on qemu-system-x86 on procursus on ios
debianization
that's on ios 9
actually it is unlimited with that bug
i think i used whatsapp on android 2.2 3 years ago
yeah whatsapp support old os versions
that might actually work
someone pls test checkra1n_patch ios 14.3 a10
parcility is being filitered
filter
it is not simple when your device dies at a relatively high percentage
should get me up to 10 hours they advertised
next week
i booked a battery replacement
my ipad pro can drain 100% in 4 hours
real-life observation
because the exploit works better when the phone is cool
well, true on 12.4.x and 12.5
put your phone into the freezer. yes i am serious
so if you mess the os up it will become an ibrick
in permissive security
to unsigned binaries
m1 bootloader allows you to jump
that will be tethered
without actually breaking llb
just mess up llb codesigning
not really
is 14.3 sep compatible with ios 13.5 (wifi ipad)
find another device
nothing
which device?
it is just that now we need to add blackbird into the chain
it always is a chain
so checkm8 is only exploitable from a5-a11
there is no info leak for a12 for now
that depends on the chip there are different leak methods
another one is info leak
yes a12
which exists from a5-a12
one of them is the use after free
checkm8 composed two distinct vulnerabilities
the exploit chain is half-patched
what you can say tho
the bootrom exploit is never patched
and checkra1n is semi-tethered while most other jailbreaks nowadays are semi-untethered
also checkra1n uses an unpatchable exploit
but generally speaking you shouldn't run into these restrictions unless you to a lot of command line stuff and compiling big projects
checkra1n removes more restrictions
~~sudo apt remove firmware~~
kppless jailbreaks are bad
is still unexploitable using current methods
the sep exploit is not properly patched
photo too unclear
apt is the best
but how long the development is is against the rules
how long the process itself will take is not
hurricane eta
eta = estimated time of arrival
that's different for different motherboards
that's different for different motherboards
could be a panic as well
otherwise that message would get filtered as well
it's more like a-z and 0-9
not exactly *
bruh no
bruh do people really think invite === ads
inb4 ignoreme123 becomes a blacklisted word
that was allowed
now spoiler that starts with a newline are filitered as well
how about this
ish -
i know
and linux doesn't boot on procursus qemu because tcg interpter is worse emulation
tcg interpter is worse than tcg
which is worse than utm's tcg
because procursus qemu uses tcg interpter
procursus qemu is worse than utm qemu
that's why it needs jit stuff
there is native tcg, utm is the example
grub boots as far as i know
linux don't work properly in tcg interpreter
i think there is
i don't see why qemu can use full blown tcg
why tcg interpreter?
why's that in makefile of qemu on procursus
procursus is using utm's qemu-
wine on qemu-x86_64 on ios
how about qemu-x86_64 qemu-ppc qemu-i386 qemu-arm
refresh icon cache
nevermind send me the entire file
nevermind
it should work out of the box
i think unc0ver installs substitute for you so
you don't uninstall rootfs
can you paste the contents near line 1047
jailbreaks.app is finally revoked
i have fakevar
ask the repo maintainer
that's not our problem
first it must be on ios 13
also parcility used maintainer as author field which is not the same thing
there is no author
that's pretty much what debian's maintainer mean: whoever that package some software into a .deb
called htop
there is a package
btw htop don't support touchscreen which is sad
how to compile libplist statically?
there is a 55 character limit

not really but that will create a very annoying warning
that gives us tons of resources
the real stuff here is running arm macos bins on ios
macos arm xcode toolchain on ios (jk)
checkra1n 0.11.0 release notes
*os binaries can be run on any *os given architecture is the same
removes platform restrictions
that's the same thing
that's a simple definition
well at least that's what debian do
which is a proper way to do it
so developers just put up another repository for testing stuff instead if using suites
also there is no gui way to modify suites in sileo right now
on *os
everybody gangster until someone decided to put up a warning in sileo when no key is found
no gui package manager frontend enforce it
people that uses sileo don't need keyrings
`yes, do as i say!`
sudo apt purge firmware --autoremove
support vanlia apt and support it well
and unreadable
they mess everything up in apt
i hata namespace ids
architecture should be: `all`
v2 and v3
gpl infect checkra1n
bash-3.2
of course change everything after  of
"gnupg keys of debian developers and maintainers"
this is copied from debian
yeah you see the problem
how to use qemu-user in utm???
parcility
namespace identifiers makes no sense when youbare using apt
that isn't a problem in debian but i can imagine collision to be a significant problem on ios
package identifier = package name to be apt user friendly
gnupg and apt-transport-https will make sense
suggested packages
suggest:
keyrings
just pack all keys into 1 package
system
unixporn-
yeah if you want users using apt to be happy
debian does it ubuntu does it
having a package for keys are fairly common
that's common
more context?
and airdrop
secure enclave procssor
use checkn1x
that's the lighting digital av cable btw
read-only filesystem
no such file or directory
real?
why does people say where is the tutorial when they are looking at it
please read
don't blow me up
yes that's samsung
and i won't help
i won't lie, yes you can, but that's violating the rules
well yes but we don't talk about that here i won't lie
download it to a external device running a supported os and architecture and the execute it
but releasing patches does repsect "all rights reserved"
lol nevermind
not really, you are allows allowed to do priavte modification and if you want to release it, use patch files
broken
this is just
totally sharing coreutils.deb is guaranteed to be piracy
also free can mean freedom not free of charge
and totally trademark === copyright
and yes distributing clip which is in the public domain is piracy
til youtube and netflix are piracy
won't be surprised actually since checkra1n did bridgeos and audioos stuff
~~adapter jb wen~~ (jk)
arm chip with 256 mb ram
dyld tweaks are good
lemme ping discord real quick
to get u0
when you have to buy 10 rebel cases
someone needs to write code for that
what can a jailbroken audioaccessory1,1 do
yeah that super hard
which is part of the iphone
then you didn't pwn sep
to consider an iphone to be completely pwned nowadays a untethered bbrom, bootrom and seprom exploit are needed
using checkm8
if sep and baseband is compatible
on iphone 5s - iphone x this is further restricted by sep but sill possible
on iphone 4 - iphone 5c you can still do downgrades without blobs but it will be tethered
that also possible on 3g and 3gs because there are untethered bootrom exploits
13 years ago?
iphone 2g where blobs doesn't exist
that's like
hey don't update there is an untether exploit on ios 11
youtube tweaks access what you are supposed to access, just in unexpected ways
which is unauthorized use
faking premium at client side likely means that some functions that you are not supposed to call is called
the point is you never accessed stuff that you are not expected to access
that's what youtube tweaks do btw
u can add ur own icons in snowboard without actually making a theme i believe
heavy is when your device is very hot and also at 1%
and yes it is very hard for someone that can't read code to figure out whether it is piracy
faking premium is definitely piracy
bruh they don't have iphoneos-arm
like how to do that in sileo
how to choose which suite of a repo to use in sileo.?
eritrea, turkmenistan and san marino
i don't think those "pirated altstore alpha" are really piracy due to licensing
if you download a modded clip ipa than it is not piracy
because the filter is bad
i mean ios 12 is still supported
~~you want linux to run on it~~
you can get old tweaks sooo not really
no it is technically 8.4.1 and below
yes that's a big catch for stock users
no it isn't
that's just a warning
looks like qemu is not on procursus
why would u want to fake it
or just garbage tarballs
so that won't work on all windows computers
deleting piracy posts from altstore sub is pain
nice one
and no, this is not mac os x
it's very good for xss
jsfuck has actual applications
discord have colours for brainfuck
^ this has colours
discord has bf btw
no that's markup
a programming language
bruh html is not
assembly is the best
and that's with clang
i have one dynamically compiled, but it segfaults
whether a tweak that gives you premium function is piracy depends on exact implementation details
i only have source and amd64 not others
i should make a desktop reveal-
that works on every ios version... right?
!gstart  1m 1 iphone 2s
still signed
aight jailbreaks.app
hey no reroll
!gstart 1w 1m one nice juicy genuine ban
upgrade
ipod touch?
what reason
because they does other stuff
then u didn't get out of it
but , that doesn't make it ethnical or anything
he means that if that cannot be pirated he is just not going to use it
...which is just a strange bsd flavour
autocarrot
darwin 17.4 booting in utm is pog
it won't work
no keyboard driver
pls boot
ok i found darwin 17 vmdk will try it in utm
idk i might be able to find a 64 bit darwin iso
different for different pc
that's 32 bit so it won't even launch for sure
if it doesn't link to proprietary frameworks than yeah cli should work
maybe
(and no that isn't mac os x)
also i just grabbed the iso from apple and boot it
intel darwin running on utm
uh that's a static image
pls i want the frbounce emote
on iphone 5s
then u can have ios 12 untether
unless u do iphone 5s ios 7 iboot thing
no it is 11
wait 13?
last untethered is 11
yes i am on mobile
no that doesn't work
a12 has entangled_nonce
unless ur nonce was set
u can't
that's something that's ignored by most repos
that's a broken link
which is basically impossible
well not without u writing all the patches
dosert bus
and uh
it requires u to create youtube accounts

how about pewcrypt
u dumb win32-loader.exe is
wanna decrypt0r 2.0
**wanma**
how to fix sftp broken pipe
put phone into recovery mode and try again
how to use the lazy option in umount
otherwise the bios might jave trouble
oh also the hard drive should be at most 8 gb
just install it on a morden pc with everything targeting i486 and then move the hard drive to a 486
gentoo works on 486
u can attach usb controller to it if u wanted but u can't boot from it
so probably yes
and they also fixed a bug on pentium ii or earlier
well the download says "i486-pc"
last time i checked
winrar comes in discs
winrar
i have a bunch of empty dvdrw laying around
originally
or discs because isos are intented for discs
windows can't install checkra1n, but can install checkn1x
windows can install the checkn1x iso
*fun*
and there is no point unless u run some obscure unixes
basically the host must be unix(-like) and have proper usb passthrough for checkra1n to work in vm
when the host is windows
but it should work for i586 and amd64 windows pcs
technically arm windows exists so that bot message is not 100% true
that true ^
unsupported os
checkra1n
it's good when u have webkit jb
that is called utm
sandcastle-
otherwise can't distinguish
and they have actual linux support besides android as well
i said that just because it has android support which doesn't have gnu
ipod touch 7 also ok
well mostly no
someone should post checkra1n running on intel 486sx because that's the oldest supported hardware by checkra1n
sorta expected checkra1n site says i486-pc download
and yes that's an actual i386
unauthorized redistribution of checkra1n
so no one is going to mention that checkn1x is technically piracy
(no paritioning at all)
and almost impossible to mess up
good because it's small
annoying
well, i mean yes and no is   not time so not eta but
bruh iphone 11 jb already happened
trying to use checkra1n on armv5 will cause error -4
which means 386 pcs can only go up to linux 3.7
386 support is nuked on 3.8
uname -r
i just use x forwarding
how can i select which suite of a repo to use in sileo?
chmod: read-only filesystem
that itself is an error
i mean that message shouldn't have shown up
that rocketboostrap fake error message
error in error
that error message is an error
*dyld_shared_cache_arm64e*
which ios version
that makes no sense
uh why is coreutils not on procursus
no dd is
wait is dd there
no, discord-fuse is
that's like
wen eta ios fuse
fat 4 doesn't exist
fat12
ext4 is robust but not best
ext4 best
so you can't really just update
as it is full
something like fsck probably failed
launchd_missing_exec_no_panic=1 time
also idevicerestore
itunes
the eta is always son
also rule 12
eta son
remember when u can only use that shitty dsa with 8 character password
run a audioos bin on ios
which means that u can do like
patched it so that it doesn't check mach-o platforms
no they
ok it is dyld tweaks
they tweaked that (without using a tweak loader)
checkra1n did it
d--- tweaks (guess)
there is 1 thing that is more risky then launchd tweaks
yeah that's a hypothetical situation
ur basically screwed on checkra1n if u use launchd tweaks that break stuff unless u do ssh ramdisk stuff
launchd tweaks are risky
u don't need userspace reboot unless ur doing launchd tweaks for some reason
ldrestart
that makes the **l**aunch **d**aemons **restart**
it isn't dumb
he isn't
remove all tweaks
yes it will
that fix 99% of issue at great cost
remove libhooker
factoryprivate.pem
"not possible"
why are we shitposting here
u0 dark reference
it's a script
odysseyra1n isn't a jailbreak tool
gayfr
where are those emotes
u don't
it was possible to assemble a full blown cli os from apple open source now it is just
cramping almost all ios code into a file called dyld_shared_cache_arm64(e) is uh
and opensourcing more parts of mac os x
apple was cool when they made actual darwin isos
and yes this is completely random and unrelated
but that doesn't support camera so doesn't matter
and yes that's sandcastle
iphone 7 (jk)
checkra1n is more reliable here
idk i still think they will add an option to enforce strict gpg key in the future
yeah extremely important in jailbreaking school ipad
http is fine if u have a gpg key
and kfreebsd and gnu mach but we don't talk about that
because uh u get it that broke 98% of repos
also not enabled by default
incuding enforcing strict key requirements as an advanced option  in sileo is a good way to start
or just make it so that it is not allowed by default
i believe keys can't be copyrighted right?
there isn't 300 repos that sign stuff
ios-repo-archive-keyring package wen
don't work without $99 account rn
making things fairly unreadable in apt
and using package names as ids
apt doesn't suck it is just most ios repos suck for not signing
just let apt deal with that
that won't work when it has depends
use apt
:frbounce:
2. that would be piracy
1. that has server verification
on pc
u install altserver
you need windows 10
u don't
and yes this works on altstore and clip as well
and just dl directly from altstore's server
u can find the link in altstore source code
lol no
preferably the intel 486sx that's launched in 1989
i know that it at least launches
checkra1n claims that they supports intel 80486 can someone verify this
well it needs to not use newer instructions so probably not
since 3.7 is the last version that supports 386
wait does that mean checkra1n is possible on 386-
u need kernel 4.0
it does
well without risk of bricking
and u can't update the kernel on android without pc so
that isn't jailbreaking
u need a patched userspace
with nothing installed ur basically not jailbroken
and one of   them is a bypass
on idevice
to use 512 gb or 1 tb
that's pretty much the only way i can imagine
utm is a storage hog
then altstore is good on 13.3.1
u can afford $99
unless
is kext loading besides checkra1n + pongoos dead
broken ipsw-
while connected
must not be apple usb-c
which cable
well there is no exploit
ur brain is the ultimate antivirus
one time windows defender flagged something as i virus because it is putting some bins in system32
it has more false positives
i can click through 100 fake download buttons on my pc and not get infected because it is not virus compatible
on my pc
i use clamav
on stock ios
they will have to allow easier sideloading
adguard-
sileo if that counts (it warns you about piracy)
at lot of stuff are just close approximations
can u read
so not all prefs stay
which does get oofed by rootfs
not 100% true
again not 100% true
not exactly
it just gives u the stock rootfs
not risky
nvm read the message wrong
u should use noapnonce
apnonce not set
there is no signs
that's so random
wait nvm
depends on licensing
enough for sileo reinstall
procursus is signed
doesn't matter unless u disabled root login
idk do that apt command again
otherwise if the setup was working why would it break?
then there is a risk
no unless u are trying to do it across ios versions
ldrestart
mm hmm idk
because batchomatic hook into sileo
did you restart sileo (bruh)
i think no
did you update the repos
install batchomatic, tap install .deb in batchomatic menu
sshd configurations
openssh-server
but shouldn't be too long
that can take a while longer to boot
piracy so can't mention
so almost all don't at least
you have to review every package to confirm that
can't say none
apt source repos are pro
online is ok
speaking about that, delta's license situation is broken but i think u know about that
and gpl text
tl;dr riley can't do anything
agpl does not allow conditionsless redistribution well in that case you are violating altstore's own copyright (there is an exception) but the devs of the agpl deps can sue
yes just hit the phone with a hammar
ios -1
"update"
an app that does not disclose source code but allows binary modfications and redistribution is not open source
but you have to patch that yourself to avoid piracy unless that app itself have some sort of license that allows redistribution
use altstore-
u can sign it urself but it will break every time something changes on the repo
you have to bug the maintainers if you really want to fix (not workaround) it in a manageable way
it isn't good
very few repo sign themselves
it is fine
the t option is for forcing pty allocation
who cares
that won't fix
ok reinstall sileo using apt
different
ok that's
you rebooted
strictly speaking, bootrom revisions
it's the same
the same
(there is **no** or)
it is xs down
jailbreak again
which device
ur not running a patched kernel probably
unless wifi only device ofc
and nonce or entangled_nonce
could be useful in the future
i have blobs back to ios 12.3
i mean apple tv breakout checkra1n exists soooo
express.js web server-
some people have broken home buttons
rm home-button
i grab that from a triple boot setup
btw that's not a vm
(that applies to most linux software anyway)
when recompiled
there is a decent chance that it would work tho
also they don't create *bsd builds so we don't know if the code actually works there
not on freebsd's linuxulator at least because the kernel version of the abi is too old (3.2 vs 4.0)
just edit the backup version
they should delete their `dyld_shared_cache_{arm64,arm64e}`
bruh why am i assigning
unlink("lythium")
all my homies use clang-
son :)
that isn't required
bans u instantly when u view the subreddit
alias ls=ban
then it panicked
where does altstore go
yeah that's strange
~~revoke~~ jk
what is org.coolstar.fakekernelpanic
even when -rf is not needed
for some reason i like to use rm -rf a lot
that should be correct
does anyone here knows?
idk they actually link to glibc or no
checkra1n team is obligated to distribute the object file (not source code) of checkra1n if they statically link against glibc
license stuff
on linux ofc
does checkra1n statically link against glibc?
actually u say download not install
yes use altstore
jailbreaks.app still signed-
i mean where else ur going to get a legit battery
for longer periods of time
if ur on 14.2 ur screwed
yeah lmao it was one of  the fastest updating tweaks
you need appsync unified which doesn't work on ios 14
how to bypass utm jailbreak detection jk
at normal temperatures i have it die at 37% once
although the temperature is like
i have it die at 45% once
me too
and dies at about 5% if i am not using it at all
in 1 second
idk my device likes to go from 45% to 7%
(already jailbroke ofc)
it doesn't work after a full reboot what
i am using anemone btw
tweak injection for other things works fine
springboard themes not applying after launchctl reboot userpsace
the name for that tool is not filtered on the subreddit :)
i know 1 other tool that is not piracy that can extract ipas too
piracy ipa probably
that popup itself is the problem
"how to fix a false system file missing popup"
the problem here is
that isn't really an error
(which should come with itunes)
you need bonjour running
it gives enough privileges
and yes this can totally be used in a full jailbreak
not public (yet)
or anything very useful
yes but not kernel
one in profiled
there is
it is not kernel exploit or anything
(p.s. there is a public persistent exploit on ios 14. doesn't mean you can do anything real with it.)
last persistent exploit chain that can lead to untethered + unsanboxed + unsigned code execution is ios 11
i know
as a jb
i mean it at least gives u  a shell so that count
it's ok but there isn't proper jbs out of it
there is an untethered exploit on ios 11
also assuming you mean normal repos, not source repos (apt-src)
(assuming that u mean ios repos)
i believe it is as simple as following a guide from debian and replace "amd64" or "i386" with "iphoneos-arm"
the bootloader can't figure out partition i tested
correction: you need some sort of media that has no partition
iso files are intented for disks so cd dvd disks will also work. usb is not a must.
^ for reset
infected is very subjective
without sep
i belive airdrop is broken as well
sep: no
unless that's some strange unicode this is true
press finish setting up and then press cancel (do not press set up later)
which has nothing to do with memory
by performance apple means raw cpu power here
how can i set homepod nonce and save homepod blobs?
hypervisors that runs without an os
and bare-metal as well
is it possible to use the ios 7 iboot bug on iphone 5s
it does work in some very specific  settings but when host is windows it is almost guaranteed to not work
considering that the root filesystem stays read only
this is very unlikely
also possible that checkra1n messed the device up
that means less than 12 hours
follow the guide in readme
to flash checkn1x iso
but etcher is recommended
rufus must be operated in dd mode if you want to use it to flash checkn1x
yeah looks like x86_64 uefi
then boot from it
flash that iso into usb using etcher
the iso is literally a linux bootloader + linux kernel + ramdisk image containing checkra1n
you do
u did it with linux on usb
without lesser-known tools
on windows at least
also u must use etcher or rufus in dd mode for that
also use checkn1x
u flash bootra1n iso using a tool on windows and then boot it on a x86_64 or i686 pc which can be the windows pc
that isn't on windows
it's not about the os
bootra1n something on x86_64 or i686
no one cares about rootless
(the bridgeos and audioos part)
two apt frontends
download the script, write it to stdout, then pipe it to bash
run the deploy script
checkm8 is completely patched on a13 afaik
~~install pirated apps~~
bypass is somehow breaking it and able to send to original string
technically that's workaround but it doesn't matter
it will be used for piracy
tbh even if he uses altstore that very likely
which is most of the jailbreak exploits does
memory corruptions are not deterministic
i think it is possible to run odysseyra1n on android as well u just need to compile a bunch of stuff
jailbreaks.app still signed-
noapnonce
magic
bruh how's jailbreaks.app still signed after the cert is leaked for 3 days
in that case i can just use termius
stock apps gets killed in background-
(not counting other ctrl+) stuff
that's the only thing i can do
also can't scroll using the arrow keys
can't do anything
is there a terminal app that lets me press f1-f10 keys
just delete one and then sign the other one lol
what is the other one
don't
by the debeloper
yes it is approved
u downloaded from jailbreaks.app?
i mean not easily
can't determine in jb mode
upload a legit app, passes review and then upload another build which is odyssey
i mean it is very possible to pull that off but anyone that do that will probably oof their dev account
90 days no revoke no signing
and the automatically revokes
i mean they can also poll the website every 30 minutes
jk won't happen
~~what if they don't revoke it until it expires~~
how's jailbreaks.app still signed-
ok sending out complaints rn
there is
if they don't i can sign all of them myself but it will break every time something changes
which is bad considering that it will trigger a error by default in apt
bingner has a signed repo as well
apt gpg signing
kmph = kilomiles per hour
that has never been tested in court so
the dmca excemption covers iphone jailbreaking but not ipads-
the "hello" screen on new devices
it is
dd = disk destroyer
package names are not necessarily bundle ids
1000 days
ssh is pretty useless until you get something like procursus on homepod
what's the benefits of jailbreaking audioos
testflight is not an os
lmao tweak injector hooking into git
eta never
idk that could have been an old one
and they are all on ios 13
ipad air 2
uh jailbreakme don't have to deal with signing
jailbreaks.app is still signed which is good for jailbreaking school ipads
12.4.9 :)
then install it with filza
ok u need to legit sign that ipa
warning: this can mess up stuff badly
use kernbypass fakevar if all above don't work
kernbypass
icloud backup-
there is
that assume you have checkra1n in the usual download location
(that source path is guessed)
actually the `v` flag to that not `v`
it will be in path
of course u should have checkra1n in your path
yes run as root
easy just
so systemd
wait what init does pi os uses
i mean a init service
add it to init
put yout device into dfu mode
is js tweaks a thing-
only imac
school don't have t2 mac
so it will stay jailbroken for quite some time
those school ipad almost seldom got shut down
exploit reliability is very important here
had to use u0 because i don't have much time and
this is the third school ipad
yeah jailbroke like 3 ipads now
also don't use zebra their dependencies resolution is borked
a strict tweak list would be:
well strictly speaking that's a package list, not *tweak* list
apt list --installed
sauce: i can read files outside sandbox from a sandboxed app on checkra1n but not on odyssey
random apps can't hack you
jailbreaking (excpet checkra1n) only relax sandbox a little bit so it should be fine
u mean linux
on that piracy service anyway
it's revoked
psa:  look at the command and block device list 10 times before executing dd
they probably tried to install linux and formatted lol
coreutils, bash, openssh-server
adguard scored 95
more like bl unlock
yeah more bootrom exploits
~~free u0 ios 14  download at about:blank~~
also no functions that normally requires premium to be accessed are called
ok i mean faking premium status which is 100% piracy
guess i will complain because resigning every time it updates is too much
use checkra1n
something like that
seriously idk why we are not on iphoneos-arm64
can't distinguish armv6,armv7,arm64 and arm64e
another problem is we are still on iphoneos-arm lol
that's basically the same thing
that is not a solution
have a bunch of warnings and errors when updating the sources
also it will
it will complain about unable to verify
apt is fastest for me
like barebones apt
packix and dynastic as well where can i find the keys
where can i find the public key for bigboss
uh a13 jbs exist
it's just a matter of time
sep nonce
main checkra1n is more suitable
a10 and lower sep is 32 bit btw
otherwise ota won't work
there must be a way to set it
(and use sep blobs + ap blobs to fr to anything on wifi devices with blobs)
it should be theoretically possible to make a sep nonce setter using exploit out there but no one made it
that can't be modified
btw it doesn't matter because dfu exists
still possible
although the chance is just
accidentally
lol but then they will need to add a check so that to make sure it won't generate 0x11111111111111
a looot of blobs
that will break
no  shebang be like
no codesigning, no sandboxing and no real secure boot
lmao iphone 2g
com.apple.system.boot-nonce
*bro it is literally a few messages up*
compared to checkn1x
bootra1n has more (obscure) hardware support that's it
that's for x86_64
you don't
and use checkra1n 0.10.1 on 5s
that is the right one
that's mobilesubstrate
cydia don't display it like that
mobilesubstrate is the "real" package name identified by apt
install mobilesubstrate from cydia
well it is more than a respiring
then?
use the substrate one
then ur on substrate
i was talking about ssh passwords btw
because sep is fucked on ios 14
alpha version
like an ancient
well there is a free version
u don't
ok i and l
then u messed up something
ldrestart
fyi: anyone on the same network can ssh and control ur phone if u don't change that password
apple
then ldrestart
start libhooker or mobilesubstrate from a terminal
u realize it is not trivial?
some of the falses involve having those repos *seemingly* rehost tweaks but their packages.gz state the download location is the original one (which is not rehosted)
you aren't prompting it
not doing something against it **locally** isn't illegal
it goes against the idea the user should be able to do whatever they want
also appearently checkn1x removed any sort of partition capabilities from grub which means that it no longer works under unetbootin
u can have cydia and other apt front ends at the samw time
like it is not mutually exclusive
it is not replaced it is just no longer installed by default
*unofficial*
there is ...?
u can have aptitude,cydia,zebra,installer,saily at once
so yeah latest untether is ios 11 although the ios 11 one isn't really for production use
coolboot ios 10.3.4 on ios 8.4.1 (which is signed) with coolbooter untethered
and hardcoded offsets and stuff
acron
there is an untethered exploit on ios 11
the utm github got wrecked
use appsync
zebra repo doesn't work connection timed out
use appsync unified
lol nevermind wrong url
finally rootfs'ed after using a setup mixed with substrate, substitute,libhooker,piracy, broken configs and incompatible tweaks
(opening random apps)
if i try to use my device for 1 minute it gets much better
so apparently the odyssey exploit succees rate is bad when just booted
coolbooter
why uicache when playing a video panics device
which is just another checkm8-based jb
that works on  12.4.9
i think there is a fugu fork
yes that works
10 apps
actually 10 but there is a limit of 3 apps per device no matter what free dev account it come from
why would u wanna sign ish
and of course finally upload it to something like glitch or github pages and there is no pc involved at all
windows don't allow sending incomplete usb packets
unless ur guest code runs in ring 0
windows don't allow that to happen
2. it *might* work when the host is linux or macos with proper usb passthrough
1. it won't work when the host is windows
wait can u have an itms at localhost
the first section can be anything really
(of course u can't use altstore without pc jailed)
and if it is altstore, it have to be com.yourteamid.com.rileytestut.altstore
as  for signing, use ish + zsign
and that's revoke free
why does people keep saying that ios 13.5.1 iphone 11 no computer jb is impossible when u can just set up an itms link with a paid dev cert
yes as long as it is x86_64 or i686
i know that hayden needs a homepod for that
this bundles with odysseyra1n as well
it is technically not on windows but well
without booting linux
well not
2 os is supported, macos and linux
but before installing cydia (actually pls don't install cydia)
u install it from a pc after jailbreaking
odyssey bootstrap on checkn1x
you should install odysseyra1n
actually
appsync unified, filza and newterm is good
no it's supposed to be supported but it is broken
checkra1n
device and ios version?
no not talking to u
it must be audioaccessory1,1
as for t2, that can be restored with apple configurator
(and hoempod actually have an usb port without hardware mod, just hidden)
but u need to get the ipsw somehow
technically u can restore homepod
without restore
and touchbar bootloop don't think there is a real way of fixing that
even a4,a5,a6
or update
or update
also u must reset the ssh password if you changed it for it to work
get the checkn1x iso and go to alt-f4
it is procursus on checkra1n
and odysseyra1n
use libhooker safe mode
substrate safemode doesn't work
substrate safe mode is a bad tweak on 14.2
safe mode is broken on 14.2
which ios version
bad tweak
segfaults when restore
bad build
f my fr 187 linux build is bad
mistake
wrong
is a no
not with blobs
which is just a fancy dd wrapper
use etcher
and boot from it
u burn it do a disc or usb
webkit based can't be revoked
ios 10 :)
totallynotspyware
also tns exists
so not all jailbreak require computers
jailbreaks.app exists
k u have to disable passcode on that version
thanks for the explanation
kernbypas fakevar
that will broke it for pretty much anything that's not security research
device reboots every x hours and baseband stuff don't work
the worst thing apple can do on ios 15 a11 is
but i still think there has to be something to do with that stuff
but probably irrelevant now
edit i mean ota
when ota
make sure bb don't generate a new bbnonce
like apple need to
i mean baseband should notice a difference when booted from dfu mode
probably possible because of the basebandnonce stuff
~~ios 15: sep reboots a11 device when booted from dfu mode for more than 4 hours~~
that's not going to work with any jailbreak tool
device type?
can u read
or if you really wants a11 , buy a second hand a11 device on ios 13.x or lower
break seprom exploit
then don't use an a11 device on ios 14
and don't jailbreak
reboot
what is airmusic.app
icloud lock moment?
at this point i won't be surprised if checkra1n eventually supports airpods pro using something like  a breakout board
"audioos"
lmfao speaker jailbreak
bruh that is not on windows
terminal
so that u can't sue them
people put things like that even if it is very unlikely
that is just a disclaimer lol
and ssh
it's a series of commands
it's another os
but checkn1x have that now as well
linux distro with checkra1n and odysseyra1n script
ora1n is just an install script
can't believe that we're jailbreaking speakers now
apple consider it as malware because it interacts with the device in unexpected ways
request source code
with the gpl stuff
just ask coolstar
and even eta is not very suitable
none of the reason is suitable
nevermind airpods don't have usb  unless someone makes a airpod breakout board
because someone recently got it to work
checkra1n 0.13 might support homepod but that's pure speculation
more like checkra1n -0.1
there is a force options that makes dpkg ignore that
which is very tricky
imo checkra1n will not be out of beta until they have windows
very interestingly one of them is a persistent exploit
those are not tfp0 0days
technically speaking checkra1n doesn't even remount ur rootfs
subcursus
c1 is
i mean 5.1 not 5.0.1
still waiting for someone to make a5 ios 5.1 jb
that switch doesn't work since ios 12
drop it in fire
~~jelbrek~~
bruuh wrong reply
technically it is still modified because dylibs still gets loaded they just does nothing
also fyi afaik tweaked spotify app fakes premium status and that's not ok
like not faking premium status
well to be fair it is a reimplantmentation and don't bypass stuff
and *maybe* substitute
u0 don't damage it
it's not piracy because it doesn't bypass it is a reimplantmentation of the premium features
implementing youtube premium features from scratch should be fine tho
that's piracy
u should extract ipa of installed apps from another jailbroken devices and use ipapatcher
u can't get them like that
support a12+
bruh btc scam dm
no libhooker is better
just not 14
i think yes
appsync unified
oh i just bypassed the wrapper
they don't have pc
checkra1n
the chance is high just no eta
technically it is software ,just software in read-only memory
but ora1n should be good
that depends on the bootstrap as well and the default checkra1n bootstrap is just meh
u can fr to 13.7
or  ipod touch
only on wifi devices
i assume u on standard checkra1n
a8(x)-a9(x) is broken
still considering fr 13.7 on wifi ipad
aaron slow
i mean signing
apple breaking ios 6
and anything below xcode 7.3 is broken
why not 7.3
please update to xcode 7.3 jk
due to gpl stuff
because pwn can't just take the exploit
well not really nvm old versions of offical client exists
discord recently upgraded to api v8
the last commits is 2 months ago
actually it is very detectable rn
maybe if it have the proper headers and analytics data
or restrict emojis there is just no ui
(and yes user account can send richembeds)
if the account can't do it doesn't matter what client u use
*normal client can't do
well i mean technically it is not "modified"
also cydelete gang here
it's technically not allowed
u actually can
~~good luck getting banned from discord~~ jk
it isn't
tools
that should be bypassable within the os
this only block rootfs detection btw
well android is linux too
there simply isn't a way to bypass all jb detection without dualboot
the only way to block all jb detetcuon
by that logic alpine is not linux either
bruh chromeos is linux
hmm than it should work
use developer mode
and certain other flaws
it's just restricted to a degree that you need developer mode
chrome os is full linux
ldflags=-static don't work
does anyone know to make futurerestore cinfigure produce static bins lol
can't manage to configure a static build
also i have kernel 5.4
it works on my end
should i fr to 13.7 i am on a wifi device so baseband is not a problem
not sure on this one
pwn can't handle this
pwn can't legally update u0 to 13.7 :)
no way
on wifi devices with blobs
qwerty needs it xd
nano on homepod s0n
nano on homepod
i mean `firmware`
no not firmware-sbin
which repo has the `firmware` package so that i can downgrade it?
apple is stupid imagine having to comprise sep to increase security
wtf checkra1n on homepod
if u can load arbitrary kernel code u can load any os
much like kloader
m1 macs can load kexts in permissve security
i think u can jump to unsigned images using kexts
kloader
like allows you to list installed apps and that's it something like that
it could be shit 0 days
yes  utm_medium is android don't blow me
although i think post-exploitation is broken on ios 14
yes they might not be tfp0 i know that
bruh it is 0 days
2 0days are dropping within 24 hours
rule 12 exists
u can't
you would want a floppy with grub on it and another one with a linux kernel and another one  with a tiny initrd and another one with usb drivers and serveral others with the checkn1x rootfs
floppy works as well if you can somehow squeeze the iso on it
internal drives works as well
dvd works well
actually
flash drive
what is the usual location of the gpg key of a cydia repo?
itunes
it is substrate bootstrap vs odyssey bootstrap
different things, can't be compared
these are hints of a source code as well
`makefile *.xcodeproj *.xworkspace install compile configure* autogen*`
succession is cleaner
it's just executable programs after all
u just lost job controls
run commands without terminal
u can
welp i just did `sudo apt purge firmware`
did he literally does force depends
why don't they add firmware into depends smh
which will give u broken installs
unless u do --force-depends
that sometimes mess with depends
could be reasons like piracy
when missing depends
shouldn't it just error
install preferenceloader
ios 14.2
on checkra1n
just works.
lmao i installed xcode command line tools for arm mac on iphone x
continuous usage
rip my ipad battery goes from 100% to 10% in 3 hours
windows 10 has it by default
use sftp
and do the unplug trick
downgrade checkra1n to 0.10.1
use mac
it does
checkra1n
in the checkra1n tool
"safe mode"
there is a checkra1n option
and then go to checkra1n app
rejailbreak into safe mode and ghost ping people
safe mode
that should remove it most of the time
well, almost all anyway
tweaks can write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem
it is just that that word isn't in the filter
there is no filter bypass lol
just remove it
k no need to explain
that's a command
dumps package list
it actually removes all tweaks
don't
command line might be too long
too long
apt purge removes all traces of a package
it should be possible to remove all
with all package names
that will output  a package list
nevermind found it
which repo has qemu?
how to turn off low power mode on ipad it somehow enabled after a ldrestart
make a backup and restore
dfu restore
checkra1n's restore system is really a restore rootfs and nothing else
unc0ver restore rootfs actually does more than restore rootfs
(apt and dpkg)
it's a small difference they are the same package system
it's more complicated on  a12+
wifi devices only
not 13.3.1
doesn't matter unless you can somehow set sepnonce and basebandnonce
baseband is not compitable as well
odysseyra1n is good
what is the contents than?
exactly
then zip the file
rename it to `payload`
find a folder called applications inside it
yes you can't
also you should paste the itms part as well
lol nevermind it is just revoked
delete that
that's not that
i mean this is signed
delete ur u0
it's pid 1
tweaks that hook into launchd
so apparently u0 allows launchd tweaks but does those even exist?
but checkra1n supports t2
and set t2 nonce
how can i save t2 blobs
it says rm not found
passcode tweak should be possible
otherwise it can't read the filesystem
you are expected to copy it byte-by-byte
because
that is technically wrong
(it isn't checkra1n on windows)
it is for windows users
checkra1n requires linux pc or mac
jbapp just signed
woah pongoos is coming to arm macs
all data
not hard if u can enter pwned dfu mode
from an actual phone
you need to dump keys
because the end user can hack it
also u need to have decryption keys
it is a zip
darling-dmg
so uh apparently odyssey uses kernel version as well
use u0 u0 u0 u0
u will
which can't be changed unless you actually upgrade
u0 uses kernel version
u0 works
bruh that's gonna bootloop
~~systemversion.plist~~
that's a joke
with checkra1n
won't work
some rpis have usb controller that just
(although if ubuntu live don't work, chances are an actual installation is needed and start debugging issues)
ubuntu live don't have all drivers
not necessarily
bootra1n is more uh more complete compared to checkn1x
try bootra1n
those have more drivers
switch usb controllers if you tried everything and it doesn't work
use dd mode
kernelcache or devicetree messed up maybe
delete everything below line 6
lol what
it could also be that some critics files got messed up
lmao i managed to sideload reprovision with entitlement bug
i just end up using settings app
and cr4shed crashes on launch for me and will say cr4shed crashed in notifications
crashreporter crashes a lot
jailbreak with odyssey :)
binger
ssh server
making all system apps non-executable
that will bootloop or break it very seriously
yeah nothing means worked
you need the quotation marks
quotation marks
openssh as well
this just makes info*.plist readable by every user
with chmod
not good
it is just
u0 is not terrible
or not most of the time because
virtual machines don't work because
baseband doesn't exist on wifi ipad
because
u can't unless u have wifi ipad and have ios 13.5 blobs
all checkra1n on windows method is either misleading or scam
there isn't  a checkra1n on windows method
also rule 12
no ios version specified
~~iphone x hackintosh~~
do u think that there will be a kloader for apple silicon since apple locked down the bootloader :(
offical usb-c cable
don't use an
don't know how to describe other than that
something like that
i know chinese
broken trigger
too vague
describe it
(still a bad idea because it is false security)
i think someone will eventually make one
(still not  a good idea)
so it was stupid
there isn't one before
well,there is reason now
of course it will be oofed when you reboot
because sep is still disabled
also the entire system thinks that passcode is on but of course except apple pay
(and no there is no public tweak that does that)
it has been demoed
it is still technically possible, there is just no encryption
that isn't a bad idea
imo procursus should take the entire debian source repo and tries to rebuild everything (automatically)
then well that bootstrap have problems and broken
but if that have problems
but really that could cause problems
~~uninstall the tweak injector~~
inb4 baseband panics when booted from dfu in ios 15
important for tweak development
i know
you have bigger problems if someone can break into your property
not really if that device never leaves your property
that's theoretically possible not saying that such tweak exists
you can fix passcode with a tweak , but not sep :)
on cydia
you get altdaemon
you don't
no, there are no tweak that adds widgetkit.framework
most cydia repos are very un-debian
so binger sudo is actually the proper one
well technically it shouldn't assume that mobile has sudo rights
htop good
that's looks ok
so no
also the abi is different
armv8.5 best
i use 44
which can be freed right away when needed
974 mb "real" ram usage, the rest are buffer and disk caches
armv7
of course you can extend the swap yourself if you like :)
ios swaps
use htop for the real ram usage
filza is ran as root
not representing "real" ram usage
disk cache
htop has a more representative ram meter
it's like 99% stuff there is
dark web itself is not illegal
(very dangerous if you don't know what are you doing)
u might want to modify jetsam as well
i think procursus is the first repo that actually have "iphoneos-arm64"
dsa is shit
i already use rsa
by editing files
you can force that to happen
cydia repos aren't debian-ly
well, not the default bootstrap
why would that requires restore rootfs
zebra is better
checkra1n team didn't renew checkra1n.com checkra1n.dev checkra1n.net checkra1n.org
technically we can only see 1 piracy tweak there so piracy tweak :)
but very few people changed
honestly it should be iphoneos-arm64 now
compitable and no migration needed between the two
and i have odyssey on  my device as well
i use ora1n
nvm i do
use it
i don't
what is ora1n
so that sysstatuscheck can start after hijacking it
source: oneweirdtrick.pdf
they do mount a few dmg's on the root filesystem tho
so it is rootless until you install cydia
because
or userspace rebooted
run checkra1n in cli mode
not sure
although qemu-aarch64 will probably work for that
natively
of course you need a arm machine to build it
that will do it
pi runs linux by default
bootra1n is closed source
it is easy
idk why the original dev don't have it
and boom 32 bit checkn1x
it's literally changing the checkra1n download link and rootfs download link to 32 bit
my checkn1x for is for even older hardware :)
checkn1x support on obsecure hardware are worse
bootra1n has value on obsecure hardware
checkn1x does have bios booting. well, at least my i486 fork does
~~use freebsd~~
i love how all disk burning software stalls at 99% because of disk caching
testing my 32 bit checkn1x fork
but i am using kernel 5.8 on them ?
bootra1n has better support when it comes to obscure hardware
that's a lot of ram for that pc tho
checkra1n on alpine linux on 486 runs fine with 64 mb of ram
it is pog to install a usb port on a 486 pc , put alpine linux on it and run checkra1n on it
no uefi is more common than you think
although most 486 pcs don't have usb
p.s. the oldest supported cpu is intel 80486, which is released in 1989
hell, checkra1n team fixed an issue that only occurs in pentium ii or earlier in 0.12.0
also a5(x) devices on ios 5.1 is still unjailbreakable
not sure
x86_64, i486, arm or arm64
linux works
pc works
find a pc
which tweak enables the upside down orientation on notch devices?
i wonder if there will ever be a jailbreak for iphone 4s, ipad 2 and ipad 3 on ios 5.1
(hacked games files are piracy, although a patch is not)
f11 on msi boards
asm is faster
fyi that file is most of the preinstalled executable code on ios
like dyld_shared_cached
but you can delete critical system files without that
some files cannot be deleted without kenrel privilege
what architecture
i mean an actual i486, i586 don't have that problem
use checkn1x
lol don't use odysseyn1x
idk how to fix but this is what the warning means
and happens to use a cpu core continuously for more than 120 seconds
checkra1n is using a lot of cpu
which means that checkra1n now runs on the oldest possible x86 pcs linux 4.0+ runs on
tweak support is terrible
even if checkra1n support 14 i won't yet
(any pc older than 1997)
it's a bug that only occurs in ooooold pcs
it should be no sep while in jailbroken state
nice checkra1n bugfix
(of course it is useless now)
patched checkra1n patch
so uh checkra1n themselves effectively (i know it actually works differently) added the patch for a11
like youtube tweaks aren't piracy because they don't fake premium status but reimplantment all premium features
blocking ads is removing a feature, not adding a feature
guys i totally found an tfp0 jelbrek exploit for iso 69
lol stop lying
altstore
everything is shit compared to linux
i am losing sanity trying to compile futurerestore on windows
alpine linux on i486 (yes 30 year old cpu) works with checkra1n
alpine works
even the most obscure ones will run it
choicy is also a tweak :)
those blue text are links
bruh it is in the readme
until you get everything
yes just go to them
bruh the futurerestore 187 compile still links dynamically when it passed flags to tell it links statically
ok i will pack all libs and linker first
futurerestore 187
thanks
a9x doesn't really work there is a big issue on there bugtracker about this
a8x and a9 on 14
nice hackintosh
a9x jb is kinda broken on 14
it is a8x - a9 really
(yes checkra1n does run on android)
tons of people uses linux
android is linux sooooo...
so not necessarily advanced
i am sure that there is a lot of n00bs that use linux lol
vm works when there is proper usb controller passthrough and when the underlying os is not windows
i don't think it will even post if the chip got replaced
good luck
you will create an hard brick
yes expected value is lower than 0
you technically can download filza, just not install
libimobiledevice exists on windows
should be enough
ok then u buy a new one
send it for repair
all ipods have power buttons
it pretends to be xcode on a macbook pro
altserver pretends to be xcode
try using a burner apple id
it could be
you can't.
u didn't save it properly
those blobs is probably all useless now or in the future because of all the nonce entanglement stuff
boot nonce
there is no way to set apnonce
how would you set apnonce?
you don't
what device
i think its like cydia for tv idk
i am not talking to you
shouldn't be that hard with a deassembler
you need to create a patch yourself
you will need infinite amounts of time to know
well you didn't give a time limit soooo...
12.4.9 signed for 6s
try it
ipsw.me doesn't show it but it is actually signed
lmao ios 12.4.9 is signed for 6s
that worked for me on utm
technically you  can tether to libimobiledevice as well
but that has a looot of problems
i mean you can do the ptrace trick
that doesn't count
technically the emulator owner can dmca takedown it now
but currently it is a problem
... whicg means that delta has a big license problem right now
... which means that, no one , including riley, could legally distribute delta
... which conflicts woth gpl of other emulators
and in links to snes9x which requires noncommercial
btw delta is apparently all rights reserved but that couldn't hold in court because it links to gpl code
clip is in the public domain
that one works on lower versions as well
or use clip 1.0 beta
btw i really liked the fact that it is impossible to pirate clip
also paid dev doesn't have that limit
you can have 10 apps
nvm entitlements bug
well not everyone is jailbroken
no revokes as well
it is in fact pog
i think you neeed 0.5~experimental8
bc that bug only affects free dev
that way it won't crash on 13.3.1
use a $99 developer account to sign altstore 1.4
all jailbreaks after ios 11 is like this
nevermind it works
that's the point of that tweak
ios 13.5
it doesn't it still asks
help?
the phone will just hard shut down
beyond a temperature some hardware protection will kick in
intemperate can bypass thermal lockout
that disable thermal
i think there is a tweak
untethered only exists up to ios 11
or get an ios 9.1 phone
you have to
no kernel code exec here
imo not really kernel level
yes the kernel is no longer patched
also they don't put it in launchdaemons for some reason
i think it just makes it chroot into orig-fs
wait it disable injection?
kernbypass only stops fs detection tho
kernbypass is really simple
that stops signal hang up when the terminal closes
that starts substrate
yeah much less bloat when you don't need it to work from iphone os 2.0-ios 14
odyssey bootstrap
checkra1n
rebooted
no i mean it actually
userspace reboot sometimes actually reboots the device
but 6s is an a9 device
checkra1n doesn't really work on a9x ios 14 with passcode
do note that it will crash when it tries to use something that doesn't exist on that version
good thing that i don't have it here
debian is the best !!!
there is literally no reason to use odysseyn1x
like ubuntu with better driver support
where you will want and actual live distro
unless you are on some obscure hardware
use checkn1x
yep you can jailbreak
i think u don't need home button for iphone 7 dfu
safari jailbreaks where the exploit is in javascript
there is one big exception tho:
idk don't ask me
technically yes
some parts of it, yeah
lol bruh
or use a linux pc, obviously
you can download checkra1n on whatever has internet connection
lol download is different from running
but you can download
you can't run on windows
just download it
too complicated to explain with this analogy
also if you consider entangled nonce it gets even more broken
how to describe
also nonce
ap, baseband and sep
no it's more like you need 3 keys
the bootstrap is going to be much better when it doesn't need to work from ios 5 - ios 13
but the bootstrap is better
a jb app with worse exploit then u0
and found that
idk i am just messing with loader.app
i will see if they do on dec 31 2020
im starting to doubt this
he means that there is a link to this server somewhere in that signing service
from my experience sandboxed applications can't bust a phone
so uh does the cairo graphics library exists on ios?
and find one that has a minimum lower age
unless you count xcode emulator
which repo have the cairo graphics library?
nice wptc-track on ipad
kernel_task is the kernel
after first unlock
technically any malicious tweak can steal data even if it had passcode
photo of the screen?
like enough to install but not download and install
not really if you dfu it is locked again
it is always locked on apple's servers, so no.
so that people don't panic their devices
i mean ui that depends on sep
nevermind
ah yes , passcode ui not related to sep
like what that tweak even do
in pongoos
it patched panic()
i know
if you are ok with bootlooping ten times you are probably fine with the patch
that only make sense to tweak developers
i won't too
it is just uh
it is not a firm no
no it is not firm
this is not how you save
you mean shsh
you can't
powershell has ssh
u use a ssh client
you don't
i use debian and i know that apt warnings like that are fixable
this looks like you installed that in cydia and installed that again in sileo
read the. error
```uicache --all```
would be shit if apple actually did that
and boom all tweaks are enabled
i always get usb errors when using checkra1n but it works anyways
cr4shed has crashed
exploit is trash on ios 12.4.8
cydia works
also i tried to remove ads in u0. boom. tampered
u0 has bad drm
bruh just stop
use virtual machines bruh
also we don't support purchase bypass.
u compile into dylib
deb is packaging
lol u don't
support purchase bypass
we don't
bruh autocarrot
just remember anything you install is run as root unsandboxed
jelbrek
u deleted ur system
wouldn't a reboot fix it
on ios 14, that is
and now you can't verbose boot iphone x officially using checkra1n lol
happened when printing devicetree
apparently if too much stuff is printed on pongoos it will break communication
when someone has nitro but no pfp
lmao u messed with substitute
bootl is the best pongoos command (imo)
u need to boot iboot,pongoos to kernel
but the device needs time to boot
i mean checkra1n technically is faster in rejailbreak
u0 is faster
lol nevermind
uh you can see i have a checkn1x fork on my github
the patch is bad but fine for tweak development
yes this is some inconsistencies
btw all checkra1n iso is piracy, although no one cares
kernel code exec is better
you can jb bridgeos
to make it demo mode
but i think that thing probably just changed a few plists here and there
yes it is
(yes this is piracy)
i have an internaluibuild
untested version
you get the preferncebundles from an internaluibuild you can set demo mode
i think if
a8x yes
a9x yes hut not really
it is nowhere near fake
it is not official
it is not "fake"
the patch is bad for making panic function does nothing instead of removing checks
restore
good luck dfu
i mean how it patched stuff is bad
that patch is bad
i think it is for loading custom pongoos
isn't it override pongo?
the only reasons you want to be on rootless is it os extremely hard to accidentally bootloop and very hard to detect
you have root access but that rootfs is still ro
that works on most x86_64 pcs
you don't need a mac
checkra1n has linux version
at least it works in a 486 vm with usb controller passthrough with 64 mb ram
30 year old cpu = i486-pc
bad compared to other versions
u0 exploit rate is bad on that version
lol u deleted it did you recorded ur passowrd
it doesn't support the 486 build too
segmentation fault (core dumped)
seems no
this isn't discord support
ah yes
on apps never downloaded
idk but appstore requires biometric
you can't download from app store too
instead of removing panic when on a10 and a11
it patches the panic function
also the patch is uh
the patch is very good for tweak developer tho
and apple pay obviously :)
or 27% , 15%
how to stop ipad dying at 42%
get it from the apt repositories
ios 8 load ios 9 untethered
i mean coolbooter trick
not install
yes but
there are less problems when you don't need your bootstrap to work on iphoneos 2.0 to ios 13
unless you are on ios 13.3.1
unless you are setting up your own itms link
jailbreaks.app is revoked
to installing u0
not right click
left click
what happened
those people needs something like u0installer.bat one click  scripts
i guarantee this guy will ask why unc0ver crash after 7 days
install altstore
go to `^` in taskbar
looks good
altserver
not altinstaller
that's the exact location of the thing you need to click on
c:\program files (x86)\altserver\altserver.exe
open altserver.exe located at c:\program files (x86)\altserver\altserver.exe
just select unc0ver
i feel stupid
also uh the thing is choicy itself is a tweak
the best
or libhooker safemode is
substrate safe mode
probably altinstaller.zip
note down the path
or ios 13.2
better than ios 11
this is altserverpatcher
unless you changed it
c:\program files\altserver\altserver.exe on 32 bit systems
c:\program files (x86)\altserver\altserver.exe
usually it is
instructions very clear?
enter the exact path to altserver
though a lot of people have have downloaded it
lol they should post it somewhere else lol
(assuming no info leak found on a12 bootrom in all those years)
checkm8 is only dead when a11 devices become unsupported.
yes but not out of the  box
unless otherwise stated
if it   isn't checkm8,it is good to assume it includes a12+
bruh autocarrot
in fact the beta ipa download link is hardcoded into the source code in which everyone could view.
especially the `develop` branch
killall -9 securityd
why does checkra1n team says that ipad pro 1 gen work on ios 14 jailbreak when no one get it to work
is linux 2.6.32 too old for checkra1n
bad system call
checkra1n errored with bad system call, linux 2.6.32 , armv6
does anyone know a repo that have the `sipcalc` tool?
it should be removing offending keys
deleting known_hosts is always too much
better hardware support
try bootra1n
bootra1n has better driver support so
bad driver maybe?
unc0ver = more options
exit checkra1n and run checkra1n -cvv
checkra1n -c
xbhide + hswidgets will safemode
-79 is driver issue
use this
or use an older apple usbc cable
use a 3rd party one or use a usb-c cable
that won't work
use a usba or use 3rd party usbc
apple usbc won't work
what cable are you using
it happens that the fix allowed a 486 to run checkra1n
yep i used a special  internal checkra1n build that fixes support for pentium ii or earlier
(yes this runs on a 1989 cpu)
ok wait i have  a 32 bit checkn1x fork
i mean x86 or x64
zebra is better
u start checkra1n using sudo?
screenshot
restarting checkra1n will do
dd is the simplest tool
sudo checkra1n
much more accurate
it should be something like:set up checkra1n on i686 or x86_64 pc
the title is  a little bit misleading tho
unless you have macos or linux
and that would be the correct key
you can download, just not install :)
there should be
when the pc first start
yes it is possible in some bios
esc or del or f2
but usually
on hardware
depends
what if this is not uefi
secure boot = off
screendump is nice, but can i press home button?
maybe
on home screen
but u can't open checkra1n
by default
apt is not installed
wait a moment
also an apt update is required
i think
wait what editors are installed by default
how to add sources:
sudo is not install by default lol
apt install com.julioverne.screendump13
btw the command to install screendump is
there should be ssh before passcode
so update first
i think u need altstore 1.4 to use altdaemon
update first
that will resign
click on the -140 days button
after you sign your jb app in altstore
restart everything that is not kernel_task
htop is good
launchctl reboot userspace should take care of everything
or you start getting zombie processes
well no unless there is a memory leak somewhere
and never get revoked
and then try to sign your jailbreak app
never gonna gi-
a local altserver
and sign ur jb app
for altstore if jailbroken
ok you only need it once
initially
i have a pc
which is kinda sad
altstore can't be properly installed on jailbroken devices without pc
well that is the answer to the stupid "ios html" question
yep that is a webclip
well jailbreaks.app can be added to homescreen
i feel stupid being in this dumb conversation
*correct that person
help? maybe idk
very technically speaking it does not have to be piracy, just 99.99% time piracy
you should be able to have game hacks without jailbreak but we don't really talk about that kind of stuff because it is piracy 90% of time
that was pretty rude but meh
you are doomed. stop. you. can't. jailbreak.
i literally said it is fake
sileo demo is just a fake webclip btw
nice filter
otherwise stock
files stays modified though
so some i have some poor presentation
don't
rick probably means the hardware
so you need to do jailbreak every time you reboot
and ram contents is disappears after reboot
all patches are done in ram
so checkra1n can't just modify iboot
and the bootrom verifies the iboot
last one was on ios 11 (and it isn't even a complete jailbreak)
so basically checkra1n uses an exploit that can only be trigged via usb
completely
too hard to explain
nevermind tried to load ktrw on a9x. device paniked
bruh i can't issue anymore pongoos commands after printing devicetree
well the only way to know is to attempt it
it uses pongoos now
ktrw don't work on a9x , right
so use checkn1x it is a linux distribution with checkra1n baked inside it and is usually installed on a usb
nvm i shouldn't assume someone asking questions like that have linux
run it on linux
download linux version
or rooted android phone :)
checkra1n never revoke or expire
unc0ver bootstraps on checkra1n  does not work
no that won't work
not really revoke
well the automatic revoke is actually a 3rd mechanism to disable apps
expiration is predictable, revoke is not
that is called expiration
the 7 days is planned
nothing is revoked
that is expire, not revoke
altstore
no one ever made a non-webkit sideloadable browser?
you need to understand that all browser from app store is just safari with a skin
(not webkit)
is there any true alternative web browser on ios
did they figure out blackbird on a7
i agree on this one
could be never as well
no one knows
could be tomorrow
could be a few years but who knows
should be not in near future
they should remove no amounts of work though
that's what i meant
huge amounts of work = finding a leak
they have to find a new leak and this is very hard
it is about the info leak
if huge (and i mean huge) amounts of work is put in, checkm8 can be made to work on a12
which tweak causes app store keyboard to go crazy when writing app reviews?
show be the output
it means that there is a problem if you stuck on grub for more than 20 seconds
no you should not get stuck in grub
grub is checkn1x bootloader
on 13.3.1
unc0ver does work
any apps sideloaded with free cert that use any frameworks (which includes odyssey) crash on that version
because of  the 13.3.1 sideload bug
no u can't jailbreak 13.3.1 using odyssey unless you have paid dev account
that's about it
finally you can ota install (unimplemented in altstore)
also paid dev accounts can use more entitlements but usually 99% of ipas don't needs those entitlements
so 100 iphones,ipads and ipod touches to use altstore :)
u got max 100 devices of each type and unlimited apps if you have a paid dev account
$99 apple developer
and newer software needed to run checkra1n on various hardware as well
newer linux kernel which means more hardware support
newer checkra1n
also most 486 don't have usb
only needs 64 mb ram
in that case booting actual alpine and run checkra1n makes more sense
but you need 256 mb ram which is a lloooot for a 486
it works
i actually tested that
btw you have to compile and target i486 for checkn1x to work (i make 32 bit checkn1x builds on github)
i686 actually makes sense
although there is a fixed but unreleased bug that prevent checkra1n from working on anything earlier than or equal to pentium ii
checkn1x boots on anything newer than i486
bootra1n only works on i686
well technically speaking checkn1x support more cpus
so it will only support what alpine support
checkn1x  is an alpine ramdisk
checkn1x is more lightweight
ban eta son
he said 1 year ago
the enterprise cert legit expired. that's the reason. not revoked
yes it has windows
his cert probably expired
it is 1 year
without revokes
so even enterprise cert will expire
also a year ago
blocking oscp.apple.com was patched recently
which is recently patched
oscp.apple.com
it has something to do with blcoking
i think
safari trick
hint: no
u really think signing services buy certs from apple
yeah it probably isn't *that* expensive
and you have to be an enterprise
btw $299 is the legit price
or idk but definitely not $100
it is more like $5000
launchctl reboot userspace
eta s0n
apt-cdrom
there is a completely useless command on ur jailbroken iphone called:
imagine if other package manager existed on ios
just 19 steps in total alpha+beta
it is not hard at all
i made that
also about the altstore beta shortcut the burrito said in a message earlier
corrected version:
reboot with altstore installed but not trusting
no reboot once
that must be piracy
nvm  didn't seen that lighting emote
piracy because
well not necessarily
i am looking for terminal beep
ipa is not signed 99% of time outside of siging services
u don't
or force that to happen by editing files
add it to apt then
manually downloading and installing the deb works 90% of the time
u can add bingner in sileo
it is on bingner
use ffmpeg
the concept of rootfs snapshot doesn't exist
apfs is ios 10.3 or above so no
i think it is broken on ios 14
legit sign with ios app signer
ok legit sign it and then instakl with filza
it means that no code signature found
well apt is from debian so you can say that
apt install com.tigisoftware.filza
that will result in error -79
it is from an altstore source
the altbackup json thing
screen
called altbackup.ipa
inside altstore ipa
there is an ipa
cannot find any altbackup references in altstore github
is altbackup even open source
ipa inside another ipa
altbackup is just
the shutcut hack is a vulnerability imo
can safari open them
of course that is not going to work
it will ask you to open itunes on the device itself
altbackup.ipa
imma try to run some recompiled x applications
nice x11  on ios
df command
not real usage
disk cache
usually it is just
tss saver
no one have done that before (or even now)
sepos post-exploitation
we have exploit
wish we could ssh into sep
it is vulnerable to checkm8, not sure if that is exploitable
because homepod jailbreak doesn't exist yet
that's it
checkra1n
probably no
repsirnig
how about the respiring button
probably framebuffer going crazy
does itunes recognize it
and nevermind in the respiring button
just put oof in there
actually
10k garbage
put the output of that command into safe mode
ok at least it does not do a respiring loop
well safemode will probably crash  which means that
~~what will happen if i delete that file~~
what is the path of that file
ah yes libhooker safe mode with substrate safe mode text
is that photoshoped
wait a moment
it actually died at 27% once when i am playing a game
like dying at 11%
because it can die at any moment when battery is below 15% in nomral situation
i uses powercuff heavy on my ipad when battery is lower than 15%
also it somehow makes the device think it is hot
also powercuff heavy is just
semi-tethered?
sim lock is related to the baseband
that is on apple's servers
that is not on the iphone
it is just apple's servers
dfu removes everything from the phone. no questions asked
bro lets stop discussing this
which is not good given that most iphone passcode is 6 digit passcode which is just 1 miliion possibilities
to work
that's not going
passcode using sep exploit if not obfuscated
bad people will start brute force
because
create a fake var on the rootfs
it is just ssh
s o n
that would be eta son
eta a few years
that is literally the hardest part
sep :(
in addition, even if they did
which won't happen in near future
still good for research and developing
at least with all security disabled
it will be possible to jailbreak a11 with checkra1n
altstore doesn't
hopefully someone will make a kernel extension similar to kloader that allow us to boot other operating system on arm macs
you can use checkn1x
you need a usb controller passthrough that lets you do things like sending incomplete packets and abruptly ending the connection.
this is getting way too annoying
weeelp my ipaddd is running att 3 fps
also i am using libimobiledevice on android
that option can make it pair without cable
it needs a cable
why would anyone uses a ra1nbox when you can just buy an cheaper android phone for checkra1n
idevicedebug is playing nice with utm on stock ios 14
64mb will do actually
if you are super uncertain
boot linux bundled with checkra1n then
that is client modification though
u risk getting ur account deleted u know?
what happened to the corellium lawsuit
i tried to add a repo with identifier com.rileytestut.altstore. does not replace the default one after restart
is hsp4 on ios 14
bro just connect and click start
launch it
what is mbp
download checkra1n for your linux pc or mac
so 14.0.1
use checkra1n
from running a jailbeak tool
what app store
imo tweaks = dylibs that hooks into stuff
like altdaemon and filza is not tweaks on my opinion
of springboard
it overwrites info.plist
and it turns out that
location
at least i can restore with idevicerestore in freebsd
libimobiledevice's tools are good
next is basebandrom
bootrom and seprom is popped
dpkg -r dpkg --force-all # breaks dpkg
he better buys those "unlock sim" from the internet
there is a lot of valid and legal cases
he could have brought a phone that is locked from someone else
he means that he don't know
altdaemon isn't really a "daemon" since version 0.3
alpine = best distro for 486
1993 i believe
alpine is faaaassst
debian
t2 is technically the main cpu in some macs
apple have shipped arm cpu as the main cpu on macs for long
~~install freebsd~~
install linux
~~ourc0ver~~
checkra1n works on iphone x
very hard if not impossible to perform from another jailbroken device
u still can't jailbreak compitable devices because checkm8 is
even if you compiled fugu jailbreak for iphone
of checkra1n
also there is no amr64 darwin build
twrp has higher reliability although it is technically no android
then there is no way
checkra1n works on android
android is heavily modified linux and can run checkra1n
13.6 no computer
rooted android maybe
u should send it to apple for repair
probably broken data pins
update from settings is less safe
people said the same thing about bootrom exploits
an app has to be still on the app store on at least 1 region to be downloadable from purchased
like the pangu jailbreak on appstore
i know
although testflight is less strict
this is the only way that signing services can be 100% legal
ad-hoc udid dev cert could be 100% legit source though
actually
and then sold to jailbreaks.app
those cert are most likely stolen or leaked (usually from random chinese companies)
jailbreaks.app is legit
the license is a consent
you need to show the license and source of electra though
you are not doing function calls or modifying it
gplv3 should be fine for rehost
odyssey should be fine to rehost
rip checkra1n not running on 486
and then you can boot the custom checkn1x build
install in altstore
yeah now try to refresh in altstore while it is running
also it is normal if the altdaemon command runs and never ends just keep it running
can you try running "altdaemon" command in a terminal
it is soldered
bridgeos jailbreak will probably allow touchbar tweaks
that is some of the things that  bridgeos jailbreak will allow
then there is no jailbreak (yet)
which year
but i guess that does not count
~~yes go get debian on pc~~
but filza have entitlements that cannot be used in a non-jailbroken device
an entitlement is basically a permission
u can't sign filza because of entitlements stuff
nevermind tang is on 13.3.1?
you cannot sign apps with entitlements like this so no
com.apple.private.security.no-container
then it will crash because of entitlements
u0 is not shitty
since altstore is static
altstore should still work on 13.3.1
and then use that to install altstore
just download and install altserver on ur pc
365 days if paid yearly
7 days if free
no one but apple can
you can't sign forever
also you need low latency internet for usbip checkra1n to work
usbip might work
you need a usb passthrough and even that it may not work given the latency
if it is wifi ipad you can fr
does checkra1n works on ios 13.5 futurerestored with ios 14 sep
actually there is no way
not on 486 on 586
it runs on 686
although the checkra1n sites says the build is for i486-pc
illegal instruction
checkra1n does not work on 486
idk i am pretty sure checkra1n will sigill if ran on a 486
has anyone actually tested checkra1n on a 486
iirc checkn1x is legacy boot
checkn1x is a linux distribution with a ramdisk userspace
also you might need to boot in bios mode
you can't find it
you can
but yeah it is not very viable right now and icraze spends a lot of money
signing sevice is viable when a while back where certs can actually lasts up to 1 month
odyssey is even simpler to be not piracy just put a bsd license somewhere and it isn't piracy
imo the only reliable no-pc method is ad-hoc distrubtion with $99 developer account
how much ram?
it is patched already
it does not work. blocking oscp.apple.com does not work
also apparently tss saver's ssl certificate expired
rooted android works as well
use utm
to enter dfu
u can't use an app
ok use usba
an unoffical usb-c cable
use an usb-a cable
ok that won't work
usb-a or usb-c
yes but what about the other end
so what cable
what cable are you using
checkn1x is basically an alpine ramdisk
checkn1x is smaller
someone needs to fix the unc0ver github
unc0ver github right now
untethered is the best
what unc0ver does after jailbreaking is restart everything except kernel_task
could also be a launchctl reboot userspace where the jailbreak won't be lost
ok let's stop here rule 5
sep is a thing
u can't bruh
have a 20 character alphanumeric password you are safe
they will be able to brute force it but if you
it is still encrypted using passcode
nvm pyboot is just booting
pyboot?
and ram and stuff
you heard that right
it has its own processor
also the board configuration is b137ap
it does use xnu
does lighting digital av adapter jailbreak exists since it technically uses xnu
is there any sort of jailbreaks for devices having the b137ap board configuration
not necessarily app
sep: no u
yep those commands worked on ubuntu for me
those commands only works only if it is debian based
not yet
although the difficulty instantly double or even triple
it is possible to install linux without usb
i can confirm that bash works on ios 14
so still no tools to set sepnonce?
~~fakesmc~~ **fakesep**
you can build checkn1x in wsl
since checkra1n have control before seprom even boots there has to be some way to forge how the device is booted
it is a custom build you won't find it anywhere
yes i managed to build checkn1x using checkra1n 0.11.0
checkra1n now support down to ios 12.0 yay
lmao checkra1n now support jailbreaking bridgeos
i have 12.3 blobs
why is hswidgets putting my ipad into safe mode
lets see how long will it tale for someone to make a jailbreak for that version lol (none currently unless you do coolbooter stuff which doesn't count)
good luck discussing discord tweak in discord
what is allow-obliterate-device
use bridged networking
ans set uid
needs less resources
768 mb ram windows 10 should be enoguh to run altserver
so that won't work
update will always have changes
altbackup is just an "update" to the original app
`killall -11 launchd`
why is findmydeviced nuked by jetsam
also you need to use bridged networking
altserver works inside a vm
right now
because cydia impactor only works  with that
only if you have $99 developer account
appsync unified
is tsssaver down?
the debian guide should work on kali
still does not work after reinstalling libswift4
it causes apt to emit warning messages
probably apple changed something that make it fail and the error is interpreted as unsigned
dtk gang
a bad thing about altdaemon is irregular refreshes
in 0.5 seconds
that should nuke everything
use dd
also rm -rf is too slow
i use keys
lol i don't use passwords in ssh
i have ipad pro 9.7"
`sudo chmod 4755 $(command -v changerootfs) # setuid`
you use the same password elsewhere
your method is fine unless
if you do that
you are exposing the root password in that file
tail -f .bash_history
& makes it impossible to input
sudo requires password
no because
binger repo should have coreutils and sudo
coreutils
requires sudo and coreutils installed
center
authorized repair
send it to apple
still waiting for sepnonce setter
given that bootrom starts before seprom
it might be possible to fake how the device is booted to the sep
and set sepnonce
i have an ipad so baseband is not a problem for me
in ios 14 sep
apple have dfu mitigation
does checkra1n works on ios 13.4.1 with ios 14 sep
futurerestore still doesn't compile on linux
so i cant restore with ios 14 sep
bad news?
the ota is signed
bruh why is 18a373 unsigned for iphone 11
why the wifi password list package shows that some wifi password as  a very long hex number?
why people that make jailbreaks used apt but not dnf
apt works in 98% of times although sometimes in will run into a http 402 error
imo apt + newterm is still the best package manager frontend
does checkra1n linux have ppc64 build
exploits are bugs
force restart
ldid -s migration
edit: added cd
not imossible
well i mean
2. done
1. dd
how to bootloop:
u noob sudo is not installed by default
apt purge apt
also filza
does not depends on subsitute
c o r e u t i l s
no this is not true
i swear bash does not depend on substrate
yes all tweaks but not all packages
the packages should be jailbreak files only
but how
if you ask me why ok i am setting up denyhosts on an ipad
yes and no
checkn1x redistribute checkra1n without permission, so it is piracy
